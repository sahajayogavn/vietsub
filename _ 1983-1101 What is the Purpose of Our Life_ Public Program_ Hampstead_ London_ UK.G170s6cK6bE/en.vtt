General Content:
Science and our mental projections are not

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.109
connected to higher, living force, so they
fail us.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.929
Biological movement within us is spiral, but
mental projections are linear, dead.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:11.520
We must become scientists of the Divine, and
understand the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.120
We are all One; all of God’s children – no
nationalities exist.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:27.920
You can find information about the Holy Ghost
in the Bible, but you must go to Indian scriptures

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.670
to find information about the ‘Adi Shakti’.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.130
Doctors must learn about the three sides of
a human: physical, mental and emotional.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.720
With Sahaja Yoga you can cure yourself and
others.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.000
You cannot pay for Kundalini rising – if
you could, or did, it would no longer be benevolent.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.620
Question Period Following Talk:
What happens to our Spirit after death?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.690
Does self-realization interfere with normal
functioning?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.330
Story of a woman with a serious heart problem.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.960
Where does depression come from and can Sahaja
Yoga cure it?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.049
Is meditation difficult?

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.790
What is the evidence of Shri Mataji’s own
enlightenment?

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.170
Self-Realization Exercise:
Shri Mataji finishes the talk by giving the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.260
audience self-realization, and She comments
on left vishuddi guilt problems.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.500
What is the purpose of our life?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.290
Is it that the whole evolution is purposeless;
that there is no Divine play in it?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.159
Then why it was done with such care, and why
we have become human beings?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:48.680
So first, we have to come to right conclusions
- that is the counseling you can call it – we

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.790
have come, we have to understand, that we
have not become what we are supposed to be.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.489
That’s why we are in confusion.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.549
We do not have answers for these fundamental
questions.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.609
Some believe in God, some don’t believe
in God.

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.209
Some believe in Christ, some believe in Mohammed.

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.980
Some believe in Krishna, some say that it’s
all science.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.073
We are so confused, and there is no answer
to it.

00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:21.810
The reason is we are not that what we have
to be.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.290
Supposing an instrument is given to you, and
you don’t know anything about that.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:39.889
Then you don’t know what is the purpose
of that instrument, and for which it was created,

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.120
and to what use it has to be put.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.719
Thus, there’s a confusion, and the confusion
is to such an extent that in that confusion

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.230
we have formed, from ideas, mental projections.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.879
Artificial, without any biological basis for
it.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.999
There is no biological basis for our mental
projections.

00:03:54.999 --> 00:04:01.719
Just sit down here, and think now, that see,
this kind of a government if you make, then

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.909
people will be alright.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.849
This is your own mental projection.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.569
It has nothing living behind it; it’s all
dead thought.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.290
By changing the governments, have you been
able to transform the people?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.959
I have been to Russia, I have been to China,
I have been to America, to all these places.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.960
Human beings are just the same; there is no
difference whatsoever.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.110
Maybe some are more honest, some are more
dishonest, some are more immoral, some are

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.360
less immoral, but, on the balance, if you
see you find any kind of person everywhere.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.530
So one has to understand that this kind of
mental projection that we were having about

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.080
other things like social work, people think
that being social work and all that, our ego

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080
can be conquered.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080
The greatest egoistical people are the social
workers.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.950
Now these mental projections have created
also lots of norms for us.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.120
Like, I sit down here and decide I’ll give
a title to someone.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.620
Now he becomes a titlehood.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.650
Then he’s off, finished, once for all he’s
dead now to anything that is reality because

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.540
he’s living with something so unreal, which
was given to him by somebody which is so unreal.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.540
There’s nothing living force behind it.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.590
Have you seen any man changing by getting
some sort of a title or lot of money?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.980
On the contrary he becomes worse, never improves.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.620
So what is the reason?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.240
Why is it that when we go into an enterprise
of this kind, why is it, we find, that everything

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
fails?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.790
You talk of democracy, it becomes demonocracy.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.230
You talk of communism, you find it is another
headache.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.280
You talk of anything, it all becomes such
a funny thing, and it recoils back (to you?).

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.440
Whatever you try, any enterprise, it recoils
back.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.620
Science, what is science now has become nothing
but atomic war.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.000
How is it science (wandered/wanted/come?)
into atomic war no one knows, but suddenly

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.010
it has become a great threat to the whole
world.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.420
Computers, tomorrow computers will start dominating
us.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.350
We see those things clearly happening to us,
and we are worried, we are shocked.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:17.990
(But/Well?) we don’t know why is it whatever
we try to do, why, it recoils on us, and entangles

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.130
us, and enslaves us.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.010
The reason is it’s, it has no living force
behind it.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.830
It’s only mental, at mental level, and human
beings live only on mental level.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:39.860
So there has to be another higher level which
is generated when you get in contact with

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.880
a living force.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.270
Now let us see what is that living force.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.610
The living force is that which sprouts the
seed.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.180
The Mother earth sprouts the seed.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:58.190
If you see the Mother Earth as it is, you
don’t find anything in it, nothing.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.400
There’s just clay.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.190
But you put some seed and that wasteful thing
that you think of no use, this mud, that gives

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.140
that life to the seed, and you find that the
flowers become fruits, automatically.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:22.690
It’s a wondrous world, if you start looking
at the living work of the living force, because

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:33.140
we are not in connection with that, whatever
we do, we go into problems, but the nature

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.551
does not, while we do.

00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:39.650
The reason is we have lost our biological
sustainers, or process.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.680
We are not biologically acting: it’s all
dead action.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.450
What we do is all dead.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:08:01.080
For example, as I told you before also that
something is dead, a tree is dead and you

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.650
make a chair, then you think, ‘I have made
this thing’.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:13.490
From dead to dead to dead to dead, and this
dead sits on our head.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.150
You make a chair, you cannot sit on the ground.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.620
Then we start another thing like anti-culture
business.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.180
That also just the same.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.000
Like pendulum we may move.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.860
Now, we don’t like democracy, to have communism.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.780
From communism to democracy, democracy to
communism, there’s no movement!

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.680
Now what is the biological movement, within
us?

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:44.999
As you know there are peptiles in our body,
and the biological movement of peptiles is

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:47.910
shown when the movement is spiral.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:54.790
When it is spiral then it’s biological,
and when it is linear then it is said that

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.760
they have lost their biological sustainers.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.050
They have no biological quality in them.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.370
They have become linear.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.210
So that sustainers within us, that spiral
movement within us, is existing in our nerves,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.999
but can become absolutely linear, leading
to death.

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:17.519
All of our mental projections are linear,
because we cannot with that in our own awareness,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.910
in our own awareness, jump higher.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.170
It is so outside.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:33.339
For a man might say, think: ‘Ah, I must
try to improve the whole world, I must do

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.470
this thing’.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:46.180
There was a gentleman I met who is in charge
of the peace of the world, and the most disturbed

00:09:46.180 --> 00:10:04.180
personality I have ever come across, you see.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:42.420
He was jumping this way, he was jumping this
way, every sort of disturbance was in his

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:51.691
mind, and he’s supposed to be in charge
of the peace of the world; imagine.

00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:52.980
Now what’s the matter with the gentleman?

00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:01.050
Though he thinks of peace, he thinks of such
big things, he talks of higher ideals, everything.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.949
What is it inside?

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:05.319
There is nothing, no peace.

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:07.220
He’s just talking outside.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.129
What is the reason?

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:11.230
The reason is it’s only linear.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:20.449
He has accepted that he is in charge of the
peace, he must talk of big things, he must

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:23.019
talk of ideal things, and then the whole thing
drops out.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:28.600
We had League of Nations, now we have United
Nations: all flops.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.649
So to make it spirally activated, what have
we to do?

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:42.829
First of all we have to come to the right
conclusion, understanding, that whatever we

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:48.279
have done so far has been linear in its action.

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.019
It’s not biological.

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:54.100
We cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.019
No living action we can take.

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:59.939
We cannot perform any living action.

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:10.920
Once we understand that, then we have to know
that we have to become more to be in connection

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.759
with that living force, that all-pervading
force.

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:18.329
And to get to that all-pervading force, what
have we to do?

00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:21.350
Actually what did we do to become human beings?

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.350
Nothing.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.350
We just became, spontaneously, Sahaja.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.350
Sahaj: spontaneously.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:30.740
It was just some force within us which worked
it out, that made us human beings.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.430
We didn’t do anything.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:40.439
So one has to understand that if it is a living
process, then you don’t have to do anything

00:12:40.439 --> 00:12:41.439
about it.

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:42.439
It is effortless.

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:45.740
This is very difficult for human beings to
understand.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.751
It is very difficult, because they live with
their ego, and they cannot accept that you

00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:50.751
cannot do it yourself.

00:12:50.751 --> 00:12:54.500
They think, ‘We can do it ourselves’,
which is not possible.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:03.529
You have to go to the Mother Earth to ask
the seed to be sprouted.

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:05.660
You cannot sprout it.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:14.200
You may try to dissect it, analyze it, put
it under microscope, but you cannot sprout

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200
it.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:23.620
For sprouting, you have to surrender yourself
to that Mother Earth who does the job.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.610
To begin with, we have to understand that
we are not capable of doing any living work

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.610
whatsoever.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:38.670
Once we have that humility within us, then
we start seeing what can happen to us by which

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:45.550
we can become the masters of that living force.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:52.749
To become something you have not done anything,
and to become higher you don’t have to do

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.749
anything.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:14:00.129
That means there is built in within you the
complete mechanism which is going to work

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:01.499
it out.

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:08.699
Now before you I would say it’s like a hypothesis
for you and you have to understand it as a

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:13.089
scientist would understand; with an open mind,
because this is the science of the Divine.

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:15.089
It’s not known so far.

00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:28.980
This is the knowledge of the roots, not known
to anyone so far, I can say, but to known

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.410
to some people who have evolved themselves.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:42.249
They have gone above that state that is just
mental, and these are the very few people

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:43.249
who know what it is.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:50.579
This knowledge is not of today; is of thousands
of years, but, is not the knowledge of the

00:14:50.579 --> 00:15:00.100
tree, as I told you, which we have, but is
the knowledge of the roots, which we have

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.100
to understand.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.220
The knowledge of the roots is that within
you is placed the root, is called (Shri Mataji

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.209
speaks aside to the yogis present: ‘Is it
here?

00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:09.209
No, ah.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:11.019
Somebody can come up, please.’)

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:15.399
Here, in the triangular bone is placed the
thing called Kundalini.

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:17.569
It is a Sanskrit word.

00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:21.569
One should not be so frightened of Sanskrit.

00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:28.399
I was surprised, when I went to America, the
first question they asked me: ‘Why should

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:32.779
you come and teach us about these things which
were in your country?’

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:40.850
I said: ‘To Me, it is just the same whether
it is America or India.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:49.350
Why did you come to India to teach us about
science?’

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.939
Why this kind of an attitude people have?

00:15:51.939 --> 00:16:14.410
Wherever there is knowledge, a humble person
must go and (see it/seek it?)

00:16:14.410 --> 00:17:30.110
This was discovered about 14 000 years back,
where, in England, I don’t think people

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:38.779
lived here, in this country.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:49.169
So why should anybody feel humiliated?

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:59.039
When you think you are English, or you are
American, you are wrong.

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:04.470
You are a human being.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:11.900
God never made a world like that.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:17.549
We are all one, and everybody has to support
each other.

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:41.760
Like a flower thinks, I am a flower, a leaf
thinks, I am a leaf, and the roots think they

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:54.710
are roots, then how the whole tree is going
to manifest, just think?

00:18:54.710 --> 00:19:15.860
We are one, there’s nothing that you are
the tree, and you are the leaf, and you are

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.950
the flower, and we are everything.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:32.649
So to think like that if that is another mental
projection we have, that ‘I am this’ and

00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:33.840
‘I am that’.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:47.930
You are just a human being, which has been
created by God’s grace, to this level, as

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:57.160
the most beautiful thing, the epitome, of
His creation.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:09.880
I would say that, in the west, there are more
seekers, perhaps, than we have in the east,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:16.480
perhaps, but that doesn’t mean that it is
only because it is England, or America, but

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:24.419
it is only that all over the world God has
this blessing and the message for everyone.

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:35.820
So first of all we must understand that this
is the knowledge of the roots, and this knowledge

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:44.650
of the roots, unless and until we know about
it, we have no right to criticize it.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:51.899
Moreover, by criticizing you are not the gainer,
you are the loser.

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:59.940
So with complete openness of a student we
have to see to this, that this great force

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:07.970
is placed within us, in a triangular bone,
whether you are an Australian, American, English,

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.650
Indian, or coming from Timbuctoo.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:18.600
All of you, if you are human beings, God has
placed this force within you.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.010
He doesn’t understand these differences,
actually.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.850
It’s only we do understand.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:35.639
For Him it’s the one world, that beautiful
world He has created, and all the human beings

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:37.429
are His children.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:44.539
So in this triangular bone, is placed this
beautiful thing called the Kundalini, and

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:48.070
this Kundalini is the motherhood within you.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.940
It’s a quality.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:59.290
It has nothing to do with a woman or a man.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.390
It’s a quality, is a type, a personality.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:10.050
For example, I would say today, Mohatma Ghandi,
people accept him as a great man, because

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.560
he had the quality of compassion.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.040
He had the quality of giving, of nourishing.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:24.320
In the same way all the saints of the world
had this quality.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.250
They were motherly, full of compassion, love.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.490
Christ had the same.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:39.750
He was so full of compassion that you cannot
call him, in the worldly way, a man, because

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:45.179
man means he must hate, he must aggress, he
must do all kinds of things to show his ego.

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:46.179
No.

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:53.950
He was a personality who had compassion, who
had nourishment.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.279
Now to become that personality, what have
we to do?

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:04.770
Again, say I, nothing, because it is all placed
within you.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:13.580
The expression of Kundalini within you is
the expression of that great personality.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:30.750
When that happens to you, you yourself become
like the Mother Earth, that you can give,

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:36.600
you can project yourself, that you become
compassion yourself and your compassion acts.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:52.269
These days, Kali Yuga is the modern times,
what was the Kali Yuga, the days of confusion,

00:23:52.269 --> 00:24:03.210
is over, and is called as Krita Yuga, means
where this living force will act, and this

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:08.700
living force has to act through you.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.360
You become the medium of that living force.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:20.020
Actually you become the master of that.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.710
But the beauty of this is that it manifests
within you also.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:30.600
For example, the electricity is flowing through
this; it doesn’t do anything to this instrument.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:39.000
But when this force starts flowing through
you, you get completely transformed into a

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.659
new personality, and a personality that Christ
had described that you are to be born again.

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:44.850
Again, linear way, is that artificially people
can brand themselves ‘born again’.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.750
But when it happens to you are completely
transformed from within, and the transformation

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:59.070
is so visible, and so active, as Krita Yuga
has started, that you are amazed.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:08.960
You cannot believe, it is fantastic, because
you are fantastically made, extremely fantastically

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.490
made, and that all things starts expressing
itself as soon as it manifests.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:21.779
So a human being should know that he’s made
with great care, great love, and for a very

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:27.549
great thing: is to enjoy the love of his Father.

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:38.100
When this Kundalini rises within you, passes
through six chakras - the seventh it does

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:48.710
not cross; the seventh is the guard – then
it creates that spiral movement within our

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.440
awareness.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:59.389
The awareness itself gets spirally formed,
and instead of moving in a pendulum you move

00:25:59.389 --> 00:26:06.289
in such a way that you jump higher.

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:13.250
Your awareness becomes higher than what it
used to be.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.909
So the human awareness becomes higher.

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:20.740
There are lots of misunderstandings about
this, and it comes from the ignorance, because

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:27.600
when you start seeking something from ignorance,
what happens that whatever you find, is a

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.830
partial truth or could be something not the
truth.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:39.500
For example, in the darkness, you might see
this and think it’s a snake.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:45.640
A wire might look like a snake to you.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.570
But supposing you suddenly become enlightened.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:54.289
Of course, in the beginning, light may not
be that strong.

00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:57.260
In some people it could be little bit, just
a flicker.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:15.669
But you start seeing then, and gradually,
if the light improves, and the lantern improves,

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:20.190
I can say, then you start seeing it, very
clearly, what has gone wrong with you, and

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.179
you start correcting it.

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:44.760
Now the new awareness that comes into you
is not something that can be just certified

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.090
that, ‘Alright, now you are realized souls.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.330
Have a brand and go ahead.’

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.510
It is not that way.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:09.700
But you become conscious of that awareness,
because for the first time, when the Kundalini

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:17.380
pierces through this fontanelle bone area,
then you feel the cool breeze of the Holy

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.909
Ghost coming in.

00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:24.840
In the Sanskrit language, Holy Ghost is called
as Adi Shakti.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:33.700
Most surprising is that, I don’t know why,
but in the Bible, Holy Ghost was not discussed

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.700
much.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:49.610
Adi Shakti is the Holy Ghost, and about Adi
Shakti if you have 

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.620
to learn, you have to go to Indian Scriptures.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:06.120
Even in the Old Testament they say Jews know
about it.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:17.760
Now this power, which is the All-Pervading
power of God, the power of His Love, becomes

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.309
evident, because you start feeling it on your
fingers.

00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:34.019
And as you say in the English language, you
know, on your fingertips.

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:38.049
Your hands start speaking.

00:29:38.049 --> 00:29:45.700
You can feel another personality, you can
put the hand towards another person, and you

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:55.019
can see what are the centers catching, because
they are shown on this five, six and seven

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:58.940
on the right, five, six and seven on the left.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.929
This is the emotional side, and the right
is the physical and the mental side.

00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:09.289
Now the doctors cannot deal with the psychosomatic,
or psychological things, and it’s a very

00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:12.509
big problem because there is only analysis
for you.

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:22.139
Now, for a doctor it is important to know
both the sides of human beings, or I would

00:30:22.139 --> 00:30:26.379
say the three sides: the physical, the mental
and the emotional.

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:37.289
But it is not so – he just knows part of
it, while a psychologist knows a part of it,

00:30:37.289 --> 00:30:44.149
and that’s how we cannot find out the reason
for the problems that exist within us.

00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:59.580
But when this Kundalini rises, She passes
through these six centers which are the milestones

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.860
of our evolution, and thus integrates you
completely.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.179
So the first thing you receive is the integration.

00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:16.420
By that integration you are amazed that physically
you get cured.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:22.769
There has been a criticism about us in the
newspaper, that we have started curing people.

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:34.909
Thank God we are not in America; there we
would have been arrested, because the doctors

00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:37.080
there do not allow anybody to cure anyone.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.440
But we do not cure.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.370
Automatically it happens: when the Kundalini
will rise, automatically it will happen that

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:51.529
your whole being itself will become integrated
by which you will be healed.

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:54.650
You will heal yourself, nobody else is going
to heal you.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.769
I don’t (know?) under law if you can charge
a person if he heals himself, but this will

00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:01.990
exactly happen that you will heal yourself,
and you will know how to heal yourself.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.990
But this is nothing.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:06.390
Is not only the physical side of it that happens
to you.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.029
Is just the minimum of minimums.

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:15.130
But those people who (are?) suffering from
mental trouble also get healed.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:21.860
The third side of it is that physically you
are alright, mentally you are alright, and

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.559
emotionally also, you are alright.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:29.690
Now there’s a very big confusion about mental
and emotional in English language.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:44.710
So if you have to say ‘mental’ as the
brain is concerned, then they mean to say

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:49.820
that person who is mad is a mental case.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.860
Actually he’s a heart case, because he’s
working with his heart.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:33:01.130
He weeps, cries, but his head goes off, it’s
a balance.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:10.279
When he’s working with his head too much,
his heart goes off.

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:13.889
That’s another balance of the nature.

00:33:13.889 --> 00:33:26.049
So if you have even the problem if you think
too much, some people are so mad that they

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:35.659
go on thinking like mad, they cannot stop
their thinking, they think, think, think,

00:33:35.659 --> 00:33:39.200
think, and they’re thinking madness there,
but they cannot stop it.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:45.200
So here, when the Kundalini rises, onto this
point, you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.720
You don’t have to think; you can stop your
thoughts.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:34:00.120
If you want to think you can think, if you
want to stop, you can stop.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:08.300
It is not necessary for you to think, and
that’s exactly what happens when the Kundalini

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:13.290
rises here, that mentally you become absolutely
comfortable.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:19.810
Now this business of raising the Kundalini
is a business of God, and which cannot be

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.810
sold.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.550
You cannot have a business on the human level.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.369
You cannot sell it.

00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:27.649
You just cannot do it.

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:29.929
How it happens is automatically.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:31.389
By the grace of God it works out.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:36.119
You cannot sell anything that is the grace
of God.

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:39.349
What is the value of that?

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:49.020
On this point only many people discard Sahaja
Yoga because they think that it cannot be

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.359
sold so it must be useless.

00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:58.770
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay for
it.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:10.830
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take
place, first of all.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:18.290
(Could possibly be missing some lines here
on the recording..)

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.290
…the Spirit.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.590
The Spirit is the one who is the master in
you.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.890
So you become your own master, you become
your own guru.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:37.160
Nobody has to tell you ‘do this’ or ‘do
that’; you are guided, because as soon as

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:44.640
the Kundalini rises, you start feeling the
cool breeze in your hands.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:52.109
And these are giving you a new vibrations,
a new dimension by which you know whether

00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:53.830
to do this or not.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.721
For example, you want to do something; you
want to buy a book.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:02.400
You don’t have to decide about it: as soon
as you go near the book either it will give

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:11.890
you cool breeze, or it may make you hot, or
it may little bit burn also if it’s a horrid

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:17.510
one, and you don’t want to have that at
any cost, you want to have the cool breeze

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.510
because you enjoy it.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.690
So you just give up.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.000
You just give up things without anybody telling
you, because your vibrations tell you.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.809
The spirit that has now shine in your attention,
tells you, and you start understanding, that

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:37.000
now I have become my own guru, because your
guru is sitting inside you as the Spirit.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.160
It has not yet manifested in your attention
and that’s why you’re worried.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:48.280
But just it manifests, and once it manifests
you are amazed, that you yourself may have

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.730
become a guru of yourself.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:37:00.660
You don’t need anybody else to tell you,
but you can do it yourself.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.000
You can find out yourself.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:14.010
Nobody has to give any explanation, or correction,
or anything, you just start improving yourself.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:23.920
Automatically it works, and little bit, if
you know, how to decode it, and how to work

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:29.740
it out, your problems, you just manage it.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.790
You become yourself a guru.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:36.540
That’s the thing you have to be.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.540
Of course I told you, you cannot pay for it.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.020
It’s an insult even to think that you can
pay for it.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:51.089
Nobody can understand this; that this is complete
benevolence, is complete.

00:37:51.089 --> 00:37:55.270
It’s not mercenary act of benevolence, but
it is a complete, absolute benevolence, and

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.480
for this benevolence you cannot pay.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.240
As soon as you pay for it, it is no more of
benevolence.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.460
And that’s why you cannot pay for it.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.710
You cannot work it out, it has to just work
out.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:20.609
Now, especially in the west, there is a problem
with people that they think, ‘Why should

00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:22.660
Mother do it?’.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.260
I tell you, it’s a thankless job.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.940
You cannot do it.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:33.200
If you can do it, I’ll be happy to retire.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.030
But you cannot do it.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.329
That’s the point (INAUDIBLE).

00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:40.760
This is my job, what am I to do?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.410
Supposing I am that, what am I to do now?

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:52.930
If I have to do it, if I am supposed to do
it, then what should I do?

00:38:52.930 --> 00:39:04.329
I mean supposing you are posted as something;
you are a policeman, you have to do the policeman’s

00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:05.329
job.

00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:07.869
Now, how can you challenge it?

00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:10.400
He has to do it.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:19.300
As if you can say, I’m paid for it, or you
can say that this is my job.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:25.050
This I have to do, though I know it is very,
very troublesome.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:31.809
To get it done is not easy, it’s not very
easy.

00:39:31.809 --> 00:39:40.400
Everyone may not get realization, I cannot
guarantee that.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:53.359
I cannot say that you all will get the realization,
it’s a very difficult thing.

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:58.109
Some people will just miss it for some time.

00:39:58.109 --> 00:40:04.450
There’s nothing to be worried about it;
it has to be corrected.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.910
It has to be redeemed, as they say.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:15.460
The Kundalini has to be brought up, if there
are centers catching they have to be cleared

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.010
out, they have to be brought up, and we have
to have complete understanding and compassion

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:26.140
about ourselves, and love for ourself and
respect for ourself.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:35.460
That if you have to become the light, then
we have to adjust and cooperate.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:43.720
Now the thing is that the ego part of it is
the strongest enemy of realization.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.150
I. I like it.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.579
I am this, I am that.

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:56.480
When you say of ‘I, it is not yourself,
your spirit, but it is your ego that’s saying

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480
‘I’.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:04.920
When you become the spirit you don’t say
‘I’, but you say ‘it’.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.720
You talk in the third person.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:21.350
You say, ‘It is not coming up, it is not
working out, it is not’, in a third way.

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:24.510
You never say, ‘I will raise the Kundalini’.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:29.040
What you will say: ‘the Kundalini is not
coming up.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.630
The Kundalini is not there.’

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:39.460
In a third person you start talking, so that
you do not take any credit or discredit for

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.460
it.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:52.520
Now, it is for you to observe it and see for
yourself.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.290
It depends on your power of observation.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:06.470
Whatever doctors may tell you, or anything,
you don’t have to believe those, because

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.500
it depends on your own observation and sense
of penetration.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:24.299
Like I would say, I went to the Union Society
and the Chairman of the Union Society was

00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:25.740
82-year-old man.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.339
And he got his realization.

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:38.690
And I told about Jung’s mistake why he missed
the point, which they understood very well.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:46.049
But then he got up, very humbly, and he says,
‘Mother, now you have learned our language,

00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:50.890
let us talk your language, let us learn your
language’.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:58.720
And then at the second meeting he says, ‘Now
I have observed - it’s not a question, but

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.300
my observation, if it is true - that you don’t
believe in time.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.950
There’s no time.’

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.770
Just you give it like that.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.640
That depends on your own observation.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:20.790
But I would not like to accept any ideas about
Me because I know it is terrible; sometimes

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.380
it can act against.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:28.130
I mean, some people may just leave, you know,
they can’t bear it anymore.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.760
So that’s not the point.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.819
You have to see for yourself, observe yourself.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:41.270
There’s nothing to gain from you, at all
for Me, you cannot give Me anything, whatever

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.690
you may try.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.790
There’s nothing to ask for.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:44:04.430
It is you who have to take something from
Me which you better have it.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:09.890
I’m like a cashier on the bank, see?

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:14.200
You have got your cheques.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.440
Now, I have nothing to get from you.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.369
The cashier is paid for, alright, that’s
one point, is different, from the employer,

00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:26.170
but not by you.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:32.460
And what I have to do is to take your cheques
and cash it.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:37.250
Now, when you are in that position, will you
be angry with me for that?

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:46.930
Will you say to your cashier, ‘Why are you
doing this to me?

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.030
Why should I take money from you?’

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:57.680
If that is intelligible, then we can see there
is some meeting point between us, and we can

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.080
talk of realization then in a way that it
has to be done.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:11.530
You all have to have your key, your spirit,
that is within you.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.190
Perhaps I know that better than you.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.320
You know many things better than Me.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:20.020
I don’t know even how to use a plastic bag,
but I know how to open the Kundalini.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:27.250
I am so hopelessly bad at so many things which
are so trivial and simple which you can do

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.990
just like that, I cannot do it.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:38.079
So it’s alright, so, I am also quite humble
about it, I don’t mind.

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:44.110
I don’t know many things, but I know one
thing, is that you are the Spirit, and you

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:50.020
have to become the Spirit, through the awakening
of your Kundalini.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:46:00.050
This is what a Mother can do, is to explain
to you, that come to the right conclusion,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:09.829
that you have to have it, it is within you,
and you have to get it.

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:12.339
But I cannot force it on you.

00:46:12.339 --> 00:46:14.230
I cannot make you take it.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.470
Or else if you do not want to have it I just
can’t do it.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.470
It’s impossible.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:19.530
There’s no (hypnosis?)

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.530
in it.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:27.250
It’s a happening that has to take place
with complete understanding of your freedom.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:36.770
I hope you will understand this new method,
that if you have to go to the roots, you have

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:44.510
to become subtler than what you are, and to
become that subtler being, you have to become

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.300
the Spirit, your Kundalini has to be awakened.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:59.170
Now, if you have any questions, you can ask
me, and there’s no need to be aggressive

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:04.290
with me, because I have not come here to take
anything from you.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:10.280
But if you have any questions you can ask
me.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:19.079
One thing I must tell you: if you are going
to some other guru, or something, because

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:28.470
I have seen also these people are going to
other gurus and I think these gurus feel threatened

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:33.119
because I don’t take any money and they
feel threatened about it, whatever it is.

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:38.609
If you are (registered/adjusted?) with any
guru or still attached to someone, you may

00:47:38.609 --> 00:47:44.000
go away, because I am not here to quarrel
with you for that.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.970
You can go away; it’s all your free choice.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:55.349
But if you want to become the Spirit, if you
want to have your realization, you’re welcome;

00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:58.750
I’ll be very happy to work it out.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:02.089
Now, let me have some questions if you have.

00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:03.089
Yes?

00:48:03.089 --> 00:48:04.130
(Inaudible question from audience.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:10.260
Yogi: What happens to your self-realization
when the body dies?

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.630
What happens to your Kundalini and Spirit?)

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.230
That is again futuristic.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.950
You be in the present, my child, alright?

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:22.200
Now this is a very futuristic question.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:29.230
Now you’re not going to die, I can assure
you, for some time.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:31.920
So we’ll do it later on.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.030
Because why should you worry about your death
just now?

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.710
I am talking of eternal life.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.289
Let’s (take?) it, be in the present, alright?

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:46.960
It’s a good question, but why should you
worry about death?

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.010
(Inaudible discussion in the audience.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.119
Yogi: Just, Mother’s given you the answer.

00:48:52.119 --> 00:48:53.260
Just leave it.)

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.700
I have given you the answer.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:09.250
This is not the time to talk about it, it
requires a complete lecture, alright?

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.690
I’ll tell you later on.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.589
I’ll write to you.

00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:22.260
You give me your address, I’ll write to
you.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.069
(Further inaudible discussion in the audience.

00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:27.130
Yogi: Next question, please.)

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:32.030
Now don’t take others’ time, because I’m
not interested, now.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:37.030
Don’t be interested what happens to your
death, and what happens.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.839
That is not to be seen just now.

00:49:42.839 --> 00:49:46.690
Just now you get your realization; the first
step.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.690
That’s why Bhudda did not talk of God, even,
because he thought, he talks of God then people

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:53.520
ask, ‘What is God?

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.900
Where is He?

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.190
Well, can I see Him?

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.020
Can I meet Him?’.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.849
So he said, alright.

00:50:00.849 --> 00:50:02.809
Just take your self-realization, finished.

00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:04.670
Nothing more than that.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.000
(Further inaudible discussion in audience.)

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.780
No, no, no, please sit down.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.500
You are from some other group, I think.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.490
Do you belong to some other group?

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:16.859
(Inaudible response from audience).

00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:18.869
I know, I know that.

00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:20.770
No, please sit down.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.150
We don’t want you here.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.579
Please sit down.

00:50:24.579 --> 00:50:27.510
Now this is not the way to behave.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:35.020
We don’t go to your group, why don’t you
take your own hall and give a lecture there?

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:40.010
If you belong to another group you don’t
come here.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:43.530
These people have been always troubling us
like this.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.099
This is too much.

00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:47.059
Why are you troubling us?

00:50:47.059 --> 00:50:49.410
What have we done to you?

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:52.539
Why do you come here and trouble us?

00:50:52.539 --> 00:50:54.109
(Inaudible response from audience.)

00:50:54.109 --> 00:51:00.130
No, that’s not good, that’s not being
kind, and civil.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:04.740
You better learn these things, first of all.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.560
Please sit down.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.390
Please sit down.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:16.060
This is not the way to behave, to go to somebody’s
groups and, you see, I don’t go to these

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:24.190
people, I don’t talk about these people,
why should you go to other peoples’?

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:33.290
Go and learn from your guru and become whatever
you want to become, it’s alright.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:40.660
I’ve already told you, we shouldn’t trouble
somebody like this all the time.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.140
It’s not good.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.089
That’s why realization is needed; then you’ll
understand how to be gentle.

00:51:48.089 --> 00:51:52.460
They give big ideas; you become mokshas, you
become this, you have become this, and you,

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.880
you go with those ideas.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:01.580
You don’t even have vibrations to feel what
you are; what your guru is.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:07.980
You don’t have any understanding, no discretion;
nothing.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.910
You go to a guru and he says, ‘Alright.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:16.119
Now you, you are going to go beyond everything’.

00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:17.520
You believe it.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.849
This is all ego pampering.

00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:23.859
If you want to live with it, go ahead.

00:52:23.859 --> 00:52:26.380
(Further inaudible discussion from audience.)

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:33.839
You believe into whatever you believe it in
your own way, but whatever you believe has

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.250
done no good to anyone.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.760
Has it done any good to anyone?

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.049
You may believe into anything, so what?

00:52:40.049 --> 00:52:41.460
It’s not important.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.280
What have you done so far?

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.579
What good have you done to anyone so far?

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:50.119
(Further inaudible discussion from audience.)

00:52:50.119 --> 00:52:51.640
What’s he saying?

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.170
(Yogi: Let’s leave it, please.)

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.869
No, don’t do like that.

00:52:55.869 --> 00:52:56.869
(Yogi: Next question.)

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:57.869
It’s not good.

00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:58.869
It’s not civil.

00:52:58.869 --> 00:53:00.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.750
You better join some politics, you’ll be
better there.

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:03.920
(Audience laughter.)

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.010
You are not meant for spiritual life.

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.510
You go into some politics; you’ll be better
off.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.119
Now, let us have some other questions.

00:53:12.119 --> 00:53:13.950
(Yogi: If there are no questions, those few
people who want…)

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:18.420
These are stupid people wasting their time,
I tell you, really, wasting their time, wasting

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420
our time.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.420
Done no good to anyone…

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.750
(Inaudible question from audience.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:26.850
Yogi: If he gets self-realization, will it
interfere in any way with his normal functioning?)

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.039
No, no, you will be very normal.

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.960
(Shri Mataji and audience laughter.)

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960
You become extremely normal.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.920
You become so normal that you are amazed at
yourself.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.640
You see, all abnormalities drop out, first
of all.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.609
And secondly, you become so dynamic, absolutely
dynamic.

00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:46.069
We have people here who couldn’t do any
jobs, or they were depressed, this, that,

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:51.140
but apart from that when they started doing
jobs they were surprised.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:56.099
The students who could not pass their exams
took first in the class, they had the highest

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.099
marks.

00:53:57.099 --> 00:54:00.230
The people who could not concentrate become
well-known artists, well-known architects.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:16.059
We have so many Indian artists in India, especially,
who are very well-known artists but they had

00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:29.580
fallen prey to, say, alcohol, or something,
they have become great artists and now when

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:35.070
they sing, you see, it’s so melodious, they
themselves now feel it that way.

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:43.440
And on my birthday they came to sing, because
they said, ‘Mother, You have given us this

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.529
new dimension in our music’.

00:54:45.529 --> 00:54:52.230
You become extremely creative, and very dynamic,
and you are not tired, because you get connected

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.480
with the whole.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480
(Yogi: Yes.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.990
Inaudible question from audience.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.500
Shri Mataji chuckles as She listens.)

00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.500
Thank you.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.109
(Further inaudible discussion from the same
questioner, a doctor.)

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:10.340
Yes, doctor, I’m sorry to say it is so.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.183
It’s so many diseases can be cured, so many.

00:55:12.183 --> 00:55:20.090
I would not say all I would cover, like supposing
you have a cata, catarac, in the eye, and

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:23.359
we cannot cure that, we have seen that.

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:32.579
And also, things where something is dead in
the body, then you have to remove it, you

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.099
see, and things like that.

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:49.539
But I think if it is 
not in a very galloping state, if it is still

00:55:49.539 --> 00:55:55.260
there and if you do not interfere too much
with it, and do proper meditation the way

00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:03.680
it is to be done, you see these are only permutations
and combinations of these centers that we

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.660
get into trouble.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:13.140
If you are in the center, you see, if you
are in the center, I mean, no less than Guru

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:18.740
Nanak, Himself, has talked about it, absolutely,
and this is what work He has done.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:29.730
I’m doing His work, only, only thing is
that today is the time for, to give you the

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:31.260
proof of what he said.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:39.980
So if these centers are kept normal, and if
the Kundalini starts flowing properly, then

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:45.580
what happens is that you get connected with
that all-pervading power which is the life

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.580
force itself.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.830
It’s not only Prana.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:53.960
It’s not only the right-sided thing which
we call the Prana, the white thing is, but

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.150
also the emotional, and also the evolutionary
process, the sustenance.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:07.079
So it gives all the three forces within us
and if you know how to manipulate it and manifest

00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:11.480
it, you can work it out.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:15.710
And for you, especially, I would say, that
it is your heritage, itself, so for you it

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:19.270
should be a great thing to understand it.

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:28.560
But of course the patients who are absolutely
gone cases, and some patients, I would say,

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.790
I must admit this, like Hitler, now, Hitler
I wouldn’t be able to cure, I’m sorry,

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:40.980
because you must have some catch there also,
isn’t it?, with God.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:45.550
If you ask Me to cure Hitler or somebody like
that, it’s going to be difficult.

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:57.010
But, people are normally good people, and
those who are good people, who lead a righteous

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:07.270
life, not an aggressive life, and are of good
nature, can be easily cured.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:18.630
Once it happened that there was one doctor
Daetey; he brought Me a lady to be cured of

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:28.349
her heart ailment, and she was very serious,
and he thought he, she, she may not be alright

00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:29.970
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:36.109
But I cured her, but I told him that this
lady would not survive, within three days

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:38.510
she is going to die.

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:45.150
She was so much cured that he could not believe,
because every heartbeat was alright, everything

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:46.150
was alright.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.980
He was surprised: I was saying that she is
going to die after three days.

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.230
So he said, ‘How do you know, Mother?’.

00:58:54.230 --> 00:59:03.579
I said ‘I don’t know how do I know but
I know she is going to die’.

00:59:03.579 --> 00:59:11.240
Then I told him, ‘Doctor, you go and find
out the history of this woman, what sort of

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:16.130
a woman she is, so then you will know what
I am saying.

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:46.299
And he found out that she’s the woman because
of her, her daughter-in-law committed suicide,

00:59:46.299 --> 01:00:03.059
and her husband had become really mad; an
extremely aggressive woman and she has tortured

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:22.920
all 
the people in the family.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:33.869
She had no love at all, and there was no need
for her to be blessed to that extent that

01:00:33.869 --> 01:00:38.410
she should get completely cured.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:44.230
Perhaps, I think her life was cut short was
good, and that’s how she could not survive,

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:48.220
after that, and she died really after three
days.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.090
And the doctor Daetey was himself surprised.

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.900
I told him himself, that, ‘You will get
a heart attack too, if you don’t take to

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:03.720
Sahaja Yoga’, and he died of heart, because
his heart was catching, he wouldn’t believe,

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.210
because he said, ‘It’s showing alright,
my x-ray’s alright’.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.770
I said, ‘It is not’.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.630
It is such a subtle thing.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:24.960
Before the disease starts, you see, you cannot
make out, but the disease starts at a point,

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:33.220
when it is so subtle, that doctors also cannot
make it out.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:44.420
But in Sahaja Yoga you can.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.970
You catch on this finger.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:02:15.849
If you catch on this finger, that means there’s
some pressure on your heart.

01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:31.400
And if you’re catching on this finger it’s
better to pay attention to your heart immediately,

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:42.789
and 
you carry the very simple thing, very simple,

01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:49.210
the mantra for heart attack is: ‘Mother
I am the Spirit’.

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:52.779
Just (say/do) it.

01:02:52.779 --> 01:03:06.270
‘Mother I am the Spirit’.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:11.630
(Hindi translation), that’s all.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:24.150
If you say it three times you can get rid
of it.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:29.809
But, this mantra has to be siddh.

01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:47.650
Every Dick, Tom and Harry cannot give you
the mantra.

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:56.059
Any person who is a realized soul can only
give you that.

01:03:56.059 --> 01:04:23.490
That is one thing very important.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:31.890
And Nanaka himself always talked about Satguru,
you see, because he found out that people

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:35.720
used to talk about guru like Swami Ramdass
and all those talk of guru.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.589
But then he thought that it’s better to
call Satguru and guru as two things.

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:46.440
Satguru is the one who has got realization,
and the one who calls himself as guru without

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.160
realization talks big, ‘I, you, I’ll give
you this and I’ll give you that’, and

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.660
just makes a big organization out of that,
is not a guru.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:05:00.180
So that is what it is, a person has to be
a realized soul, and he must know all the

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.809
details about how to do it.

01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:06.349
Now, as if you are interested, I would like
to meet some of you doctors here, and I tell

01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:10.819
you all about it, details, and I can make
you master in no time, there’s no problem.

01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:15.940
But a Sahaja Yogi is a person who knows all
about Kundalini, he knows how to deal with

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.650
it, how to work it out.

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:22.510
Now he himself is a doctor, and he has cured
many people with Sahaja Yoga, and is a very

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.750
simple thing, and which can work out.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.329
Thank God this country is a free country in
this respect, and that they have asked us

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:32.109
to write to them about this method of Sahaja
Yoga; how we cure people.

01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:33.109
But that’s just the basics.

01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:35.329
That’s not so important.

01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:37.510
What is important is to become the spirit.

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:41.250
(Inaudible question from same audience member.)

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.740
Yes, by all means.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:44.980
Why not?

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.590
I would love to have you for tea at my residence.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.114
You give your name and address and I’ll,
I’ll let you know.

01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:52.290
I thank you very much.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.940
Thank you very much doctor.

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.940
Yes.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.059
(Yogi: Any more?

01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:58.059
Yes.)

01:05:58.059 --> 01:06:00.240
(Inaudible question from audience member.)

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.359
What did he say?

01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:04.799
(Yogi: Sorry, could you say again?

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:05.799
Ah.

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.849
And you’re asking will it help.)

01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:08.849
Yes.

01:06:08.849 --> 01:06:09.920
(Yogi: His son has been very depressed.)

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.510
Where do you live, in what part?

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:12.650
(Inaudible response from audience member.)

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:13.650
Alright.

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:14.650
It’s not difficult; we have a center here.

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.540
(Inaudible discussion from the man.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:29.079
Yogi: So, medication doesn’t help, is that
what you’re saying?…)

01:06:29.079 --> 01:06:31.029
(Inaudible response.)

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.990
(Yogi: Ah.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:37.540
No medication is required at the moment but
they as parents are very worried about him.)

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:42.140
No, I know, depression is also to be understood
in its full, full extent.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.119
How people get depressed, you see?

01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:47.130
And how people get into problems on depression.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:51.369
It’s very simple and it can be cured.

01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:52.400
He can be cured.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.289
We have people here who were very depressed
and now today they have become dynamic people,

01:06:56.289 --> 01:06:57.289
so it’s alright.

01:06:57.289 --> 01:07:02.289
You can, you can go to the center, you take
the address of the center, and you, you take

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.599
the photograph, and they, we’ll manage.

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:06.260
You just don’t worry, they’ll tell you
how to do it, but do it religiously.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.960
The way they are telling you if you do it.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.539
It’s very simple methods, they will tell
you; you have to have faith in yourself and

01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:15.819
you have to do it religiously, it will work
out.

01:07:15.819 --> 01:07:17.789
I promise it can be worked out.

01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:20.839
Now, behind you is sitting there some Mohan,
is sitting, just see that boy, sitting behind

01:07:20.839 --> 01:07:25.310
you, and he had been to some guru like that,
who just ruined his awareness completely.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:27.630
He was really, absolutely, out of mind.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.630
And now you won’t believe, he writes poetry
so beautifully, like, when I read it I think

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:29.630
of Kabir, like that.

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:30.630
He’s writing poetry now.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:31.630
So it’s something so different, you know?

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.630
So, it can happen.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:33.630
You just bring the, you take the address and
bring the photograph of the boy, with his

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:37.359
birth date and all that and give it to them,
we’ll work it out.

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:38.660
(Inaudible comment from man.)

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.660
He’s an artist?

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:40.660
Then it’s alright.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.940
He’ll become a greater artist.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.940
(Laugher from audience.)

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:43.940
(Yogi: Yes?

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:53.180
Audience member: Asking about special diet,
the difficulty of meditation) It was not hard

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.579
at all!

01:07:57.579 --> 01:08:04.190
(Shri Mataji laughs.)

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:10.789
(Audience member: Laughs.

01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:17.400
It wasn’t hard!

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.600
…INAUDIBLE…)

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.200
No, no, no.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:36.650
You see, it is Sahaja Samadhi.

01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:42.069
It is Sahaja.

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:44.670
Sahaja has another meaning also; easy.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:51.509
That’s the quality of your mother, I should
say, has to be (easier/easiest?).

01:08:51.509 --> 01:08:53.759
Mother gives you birth, does she give you
any trouble?

01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:54.759
Nothing.

01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:56.900
She takes all the trouble, so you don’t
have to worry.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.870
Kundalini takes all the trouble within you,
you don’t have to do anything.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:04.130
So it’s very Sahaj, is absolutely Sahaj.

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:05.130
It is absolutely spontaneous.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.980
It doesn’t give you trouble at all.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.140
It is absolutely easy, easy as possible.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.950
Has to be, because it is so vital.

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:18.969
Whatever is not vital is like this, that guru
says, ‘Don’t eat this, don’t do that,

01:09:18.969 --> 01:09:20.969
stand on your heads, do this, do that’.

01:09:20.969 --> 01:09:22.810
That’s not the mother’s style.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:32.941
But the real gurus, also, they’re very strict,
no doubt, but the real gurus give you realization.

01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:33.950
That’s the first thing they do.

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:37.310
They don’t tell you that, ‘I’ll take
you to mokshas, I’ll do this’, nothing

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:38.310
of these big talks.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:42.140
They say that, ‘First of all you get your
realization’.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:47.700
Any other question, please.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:58.830
(Inaudible question from audience member and
general laughter.

01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:04.030
Yogi: Can you give some evidence of Your own
enlightenment?

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:10.390
Shri Mataji laughs, more audience laughter.)

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:11.690
What evidence you want?

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.440
What evidence you understand?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.050
You see, the evidence is if your Kundalini
is awakened, then only you will understand.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:22.340
What Christ could not give evidence (so/to?)
you crucified him nicely.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.015
But I am going to give you the evidence, you
the evidence.

01:10:25.015 --> 01:10:26.015
I will give you.

01:10:26.015 --> 01:10:27.015
You sit down, you get your realization, then
you’ll get the evidence, alright?

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:28.015
Once you get your realization you’ll get
the evidence, isn’t it?

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.015
What is the evidence that the candle is enlightened?

01:10:29.015 --> 01:10:30.015
That it when you take it near an unlit, unlit…supposing
this is an enlightened candle, the evidence

01:10:30.015 --> 01:10:31.015
is that it can enlighten another candle, isn’t
it?

01:10:31.015 --> 01:10:32.015
That is the evidence.

01:10:32.015 --> 01:10:33.015
Now you sit down, first you, let’s see if
you get realization.

01:10:33.015 --> 01:10:34.015
That’s the evidence, alright?

01:10:34.015 --> 01:10:35.015
If you don’t get the realization, then the
evidence is that something wrong with you,

01:10:35.015 --> 01:10:36.015
because many will get it.

01:10:36.015 --> 01:10:37.015
It’s you who has to give Me the evidence,
not Me, because I don’t have, you see, these

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.015
questions are alright for a person who’s
taking money from you, or taking anything

01:10:38.015 --> 01:10:39.015
from you, or I’m telling you anything, nothing,
I’m just saying, you take it.

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:40.015
These questions are just other way around,
should be, isn’t it?

01:10:40.015 --> 01:10:41.015
It is you who has to give the evidence that
you have got it, not Me.

01:10:41.015 --> 01:10:42.015
Here at least there are 60% people who have
got it.

01:10:42.015 --> 01:10:43.015
60% people.

01:10:43.015 --> 01:10:44.015
So if you get it, thank your stars that you’ve
got it.

01:10:44.015 --> 01:10:45.015
If you don’t get it I’ll have to work
hard with you.

01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:46.015
(Yogi: Why don’t we all ask for it now.

01:10:46.015 --> 01:10:47.015
Just slip your shoes off, and put your hands
on your lap, put your hands out, and ask for

01:10:47.015 --> 01:10:48.015
it.

01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:49.015
Ask for it in your heart, that is.)

01:10:49.015 --> 01:10:50.015
I think all of you should get seated down,
first of all, properly.

01:10:50.015 --> 01:10:51.015
You see?

01:10:51.015 --> 01:10:52.015
There should be no (INAUDIBLE).

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:53.015
Please be seated.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.015
There are some seats here.

01:10:54.015 --> 01:10:55.015
Come along.

01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:56.015
There are some seats here, also.

01:10:56.015 --> 01:10:57.015
There’s one thing I have to tell you, that
it is something that happens within yourself,

01:10:57.015 --> 01:10:58.015
and it is a very quick thing; it’s the split
of a second, when the Kundalini rises, just

01:10:58.015 --> 01:10:59.015
split of a second.

01:10:59.015 --> 01:11:00.015
But, if there is any obstruction, then it
takes some time, and I have seen, that say,

01:11:00.015 --> 01:11:01.015
in an Indian village, I have seen 6000 people
just get realization in the split of a second,

01:11:01.015 --> 01:11:02.015
but, the more we get sophisticated and modernized,
we get complicated.

01:11:02.015 --> 01:11:03.015
So, we have to, little bit, give some energy
to our different centers, and try to nourish

01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:04.015
it, so that the Kundalini is moving faster,
without any obstruction.

01:11:04.015 --> 01:11:05.015
To remove the obstruction, we have to work
it out in a very simple way, which I’ll

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:06.015
tell you, that left hand you have to put like
this, which is the power of desire.

01:11:06.015 --> 01:11:07.015
So put the left hand like this.

01:11:07.015 --> 01:11:08.015
All these things I cannot explain in one,
one lecture, and it’s too much, also, like

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:09.015
I would say that if you had to switch on then
you just pull the switch and the lights will

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.015
be on.

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:11.015
In the same way we can say put this left hand
straight like this, just like this, on your

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:12.015
lap, very comfortably, and with the right
hand, I will say where to go.

01:11:12.015 --> 01:11:13.015
Now first of all, you must close your eyes,
and don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

01:11:13.015 --> 01:11:14.015
Take out your spectacles if possible, and…
it’s already going to deep I can’t keep

01:11:14.015 --> 01:11:15.015
my eyes open…

01:11:15.015 --> 01:11:16.015
now put the left hand towards Me and with
the right hand you have to move, so keep your

01:11:16.015 --> 01:11:17.015
eyes shut and also, if you can take out your
spectacles it’s better because you don’t

01:11:17.015 --> 01:11:18.015
have to see anything.

01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:19.015
Better, it’s good for the eyesight.

01:11:19.015 --> 01:11:20.530
So better take out your spectacles, and be
comfortable.

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:23.880
There should be nothing tight anywhere in
the body, anywhere.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.389
Now, what you put your left hand towards Me,
and with the right hand, right hand, you put

01:11:27.389 --> 01:11:28.389
it on your heart on the left-hand side, to
begin with.

01:11:28.389 --> 01:11:29.389
It’s very important.

01:11:29.389 --> 01:11:31.890
Now, on the heart, we are putting it, first
of all, because we have to say that ‘Mother,

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.890
I am the Spirit’.

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:33.890
You can address Me as Shri Mataji, as Mother,
whatever.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:34.890
If it is easier for you to say Shri Mataji,
is alright, otherwise to make it easier you

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:35.890
can call Me Mother.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:36.890
I am the Spirit.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:37.890
Everyone should try.

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.890
Everyone should try.

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:39.890
Or you can ask a question: ‘Am I the Spirit?’.

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:40.890
Now, slowly take this side down on the left-hand
side of your stomach, left-hand side of your

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:41.890
stomach, and press it hard.

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:42.890
Left-hand side of your stomach.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:43.890
Don’t open your eyes.

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:44.890
Put this right hand on the left-hand side
of your stomach, because there resides the

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:45.890
principle of the Primordial master, of your
mastery.

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:46.890
So here, you have to say, ten times, because
you have ten valencies.

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:47.890
As human beings we have ten valencies, so
we have to say ten times: ‘Mother, I am

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:48.890
my own master.

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:49.890
I am my own guru’, to awaken within you
the Primordial master.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:50.890
‘I am my own guide.’

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:51.890
With full confidence.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:52.890
Without any guilt, without any guilt.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:53.890
Without any guilt you have to say, ‘I’m
my own master’.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:54.890
This is one of the diseases in the west; to
feel guilty.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:55.890
At the present moment, your past is not there.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:56.890
You just worry, don’t worry about your past.

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.890
You just say, ‘Mother, I am my own master’
with full confidence.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.890
Don’t feel guilty.

01:11:58.890 --> 01:11:59.890
(Long pause.)

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:00.890
Please don’t feel guilty throughout.

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:01.890
Please don’t feel guilty at all.

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.890
And don’t count your sins but count your
blessings.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:03.890
Now raise this right hand, again, back to
the heart, with complete love and understanding

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:04.890
about yourself, and full respect, because
you are at the epitome of the evolution.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.890
You must respect yourself.

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:06.890
At this point, you have to say 12 times, ‘Mother
I am the Spirit’, because at this chakras,

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:07.890
there are twelve sub-chakras, that’s why
it is to be said 12 times, or petals, sub-petals

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.890
as they call it.

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:09.890
Mother, I am the Spirit.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:10.890
Just say that.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:11.890
You are the Spirit, believe Me, you are.

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:12.890
Just say that.

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:13.890
(Long pause.

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:14.890
Yogi tells Mother that he and/or the other
yogis present feel left vishuddi.)

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:15.890
Now don’t feel guilty at that time.

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:16.890
Don’t weep, or cry, don’t feel bad.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:17.890
Just say, ‘Mother, I am not guilty, I am
the Spirit’, with full confidence, you are.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:18.890
Don’t feel guilty.

01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:19.890
This feeling guilty causes angina, one part
of it, I tell you.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:20.890
Now, with that fear at least you’ll stop
feeling guilty.

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:21.890
(Shri Mataji chuckles.

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:22.890
She says to yogis), Hmm, better.

01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:23.890
Now put that right hand on the base of your
neck on the left-hand side, from the front.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:24.890
From the front.

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:25.890
On the base, on the left-hand side.

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.890
Base of your neck on the left-hand side, take
your hand in front, not from the back.

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:27.890
Now press it hard, a little.

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:28.890
Now this is the point, which catches very
badly, when you feel guilty.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:29.890
Now, just say, ‘Mother, I am not guilty’,
16 times.

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:30.890
But I always say that if you have too much
of this fashion, of feeling guilty, then you

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:31.890
may punish yourself by saying 35 times, or
108 times.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.890
Just laugh at yourself for feeling guilty;
that’s the best way.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:33.890
Do not condemn yourself.

01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:34.890
Say it 16 times.

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:35.890
(Long pause.)

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:36.890
Still you are feeling guilty.

01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:37.890
Now, put this hand on your forehead across,
without feeling guilty again.

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:38.890
Throughout I have to say this because that’s
the main thing you’re catching, all the

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:39.890
time, and at this point you have to say, ‘Mother,
I forgive everyone’.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:40.890
Just say that.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.890
Now, somebody would say that it’s very difficult
to forgive, and all that.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:42.890
It is all a myth.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:43.890
When you don’t forgive anyone, what do you
do?

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:44.890
Nothing.

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:45.890
You are actually cursing yourself, and torturing
yourself.

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:46.890
So I forgive everyone.

01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:47.890
Mother, I forgive everyone.

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:48.890
Forgive everyone.

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:49.890
(Shri Mataji says mantras quietly.)

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:50.890
Now put this hand at the back, on the backside
of your head, and pull it out a little bit.

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:51.890
Press it a little bit.

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:52.890
Now at this point, without feeling guilty,
again I say without feeling guilty, at all,

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:53.890
just to say, that, ‘Oh Lord, Oh God, if
we have done any mistake, please forgive us’.

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:54.890
But don’t feel guilty.

01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:55.890
(Pause.)

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:56.890
At the back, just at the back of your head.

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:57.890
(Longer pause as Mother speaks quietly aside
to the yogi/yogis.)

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:58.890
Now, put this hand on top of your head, and
press it, on the fontanelle bone area, where

01:12:58.890 --> 01:12:59.890
you had a soft bone in your childhood, and
just press it, and rub it a little bit, and

01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:00.890
at this point as I said, I cannot cross your
freedom.

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:01.890
You have to ask for it.

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.890
You have to say, ‘Mother, I want my realization,
give me my realization’.

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:03.890
Say it seven times here.

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:04.890
Ask for it.

01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:05.890
You have to ask for it.

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:06.890
You must know that the Divine is not going
to fall at your feet.

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:07.890
You have to humble down, and ask for it, otherwise
it will not work out.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:08.890
(Pause; Mother speaks again, quietly, to yogis.)

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:09.890
Now raise your hand, and see if there’s
a cool breeze coming in.

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:10.890
Just not much, about five inches, six inches
higher, on top of your head.

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:11.890
Now put down right hand, on your lap.

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:12.890
Don’t open your eyes, please.

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:13.890
Keep quiet.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:13.895
END

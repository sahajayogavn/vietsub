Title: Talk on evening before Sahastrara Puja
Location: Thredbo, Australia

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:17.560
Date: 2.5.1987

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:27.349
So very nice to see you all here, all my children.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:35.870
Your love out beats me.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.670
I really find no words to express my feelings.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:55.480
The way you have taken to Sahaja Yoga and
the way you have established yourself in Sahaj

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480
Yog.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.030
I know it is very difficult to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.170
Everywhere it is difficult because you know
these are the times of kaliyuga.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:24.690
I am not tired of the journey so much as the
fighting the evil forces around us.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:35.599
When I came to Canberra, I felt the left swadhistana
very strong, so strong that I could not walk

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.520
few steps and I asked them what’s the matter?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.770
They told me that TM, there is some Chinmoy
fellow, they are very strong here.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.599
Apart from that there are other spiritualist
forces which they are announcing in the newspapers.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:08.870
It’s shocking that human beings take to
these horrible things so easily and try to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.819
work it out.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:20.000
When you study the reason why they take to
these horrible things then you realize one

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.420
thing that these things promise quick results.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.340
Like supposing somebody’s son has been lost.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.360
So, they will say, “All right.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.710
You come to our group, we’ll find it out
for you.”

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.480
Or else, somebody says, “I am under a great
strain.”

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.500
“All right.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.940
You come to our group, we will remove your
strains.”

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:57.890
It’s very easy to remove the strains by
putting a entity, what we call the bhoots,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.570
into someone so that the bhoot takes over
for the time being.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.030
But, here the seeker is not a deep person.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.890
Those who were deep people came back from
all these horrible people.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:22.700
With the TM, I can tell you, we have been
able to salvage some people, not all of them.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:32.650
When first it was brought to my notice, I
had a meeting in England and we had from TM

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.380
at least hundred people.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:42.560
Out of which we can say about ten to twelve
people we have been able to salvage.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.990
But the growth, spiritual growth in them was
very slow and they were just frightened of

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.990
Me.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.990
They would not look at Me.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.660
They had awe about Me.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.580
Whenever they saw me they would shake.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:07.410
There is one fellow, Chinese, who came from
TM, and I think Rustom was there, and he just

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:17.101
took My name and he jumped under a table and
landed himself outside in the lounge and they

00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:21.630
started looking at him where has he disappeared.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:30.230
With this Chinese fellow, we tried with him,
but he used to shake and horrible [UNCLEAR],

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.230
poor thing.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:45.250
Then he left Sahaja Yoga in a way and somebody
met him in a restaurant or in a book shop

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:51.100
and somebody met him there, and they asked
him, “How do you feel?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.550
How do you feel about Mother?”

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.550
He said, “Oh!

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.550
Ho!

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.550
Ho!

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.550
Ho!

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.550
She is a tremendous power.”

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:06.590
So, you see, they are so weak, they are so
gone down.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.100
It’s very difficult to bring them to normal
conditions.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.280
Within two, three years they become recluses.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.950
They are even afraid of, what you call garlic.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.460
If you show them the garlic they start shaking.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.360
If you show them the lemon they start shaking.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.320
They become recluses.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.460
We get few people from there, TM, but their
bhoots are so strong that they will not stick

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.500
on to us much.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.840
Even they come down for a short time, again
they go back.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.990
So, this is the situation with these TM people.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:54.800
And with this Chinmoy fellow I had an encounter
in America and there the people they came

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.870
and told me that “Why this Chinmoy is here
and why doesn’t your husband tell to Secretary

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.460
General about it?”

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.640
And you know who was the Secretary General
that time, [Wol Dahm?] and all the rest of

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.530
it.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.960
And they were all crazy people.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.780
How Wol Dahm is now being cheated by people
and now he is not allowed to go to America

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.780
and all that.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:24.680
Actually his luck was not so bad but this
bhoots, you see, they made him so funny that

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.070
he just could not come back to his normal
self.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:37.159
Now this gentleman was not so much into this
Chinmoy but there was one south Indian gentleman

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.120
who was in the UN and he said that “This
Chinmoy is very good.”

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.829
This Chinmoy used to play tennis, used to
swim, used to drink, have women, he was a

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:52.890
real yanky and despite that people said, “Oh!

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.939
He is great because he knows how to speak
well.”

00:08:56.939 --> 00:09:02.190
So, all those speech loving people he got.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:08.920
That’s another style of people who are not
seekers but who just want somebody to talk,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.410
talk, and talk.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:16.230
He could talk on Gita, he could talk on this,
he could talk on every kind of thing.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:25.519
Now, the big difference is, in Sahaja Yoga
you have to accept Me.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:29.019
There you don’t have to accept anyone.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:35.050
As long as you accept Gita, as long as you
accept Bible, as long as you accept something

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.050
– is not there, which is dead, which is
finished.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.560
So, these people are interested only in your
money.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:52.060
So, they don’t worry about these old, we
should say, prophets who are dead now or we

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.279
can say the incarnations who are dead.

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:56.269
They have nothing to do.

00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:58.240
Just they describe them, take the money.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.810
That’s they want.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.829
They only want to have money, money, money
and money.

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:06.790
They are not interested in your welfare or
anything.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.389
They have no idea of Kundalini, they cannot
raise your Kundalini, they cannot give you

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:16.930
realization, they cannot look after you – nothing
of the kind.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.769
Only thing what they want, whatever money
you have they should have it.

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:27.420
And the way they do it is a very camouflage
sort of a drama they play, that they can deliver

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420
the goods.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:35.730
What are the goods they are going to deliver
to you?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.439
Except Self-Realization.

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:43.329
Even the people who talked of Self-Realization
never gave Self-Realization to anyone.

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:45.949
I have seen this Yogananda’s disciples.

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:54.149
The early ones, they had to cut their tongues
because according to him, in his own kriyayoga,

00:10:54.149 --> 00:11:01.959
you had to put back your tongue here for a
khechri and that’s why they had to cut their

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:02.959
tongue.

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:03.959
They cannot speak, they cannot do anything.

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:07.079
They are just like dogs, you see, wagging
their tails.

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:13.529
Very good people, they are doctors, architects,
very good people.

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:19.439
All these things have happened to all these
great seekers, I should say, but they were

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:22.800
stupid to accept anyone like that.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:30.370
First of all, you must see what are other,
are doing others, say other disciples are

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.370
doing.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.110
How are they, majority of them?

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:39.490
In Sahaja Yoga also we might get somebody
a very useless person and might get somebody

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.820
a very low grade or a very low caliber personality.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.850
We do get on the periphery, we do get.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.740
But they should see other people who are seriously
involved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.600
How they are behaving?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.019
What is their way of doing it?

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:59.040
And how their life is?

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.560
What have they achieved?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.540
What powers have they achieved?

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.670
And what kind of a life they lead?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.690
That is how you should judge the person to
whom they have to do.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:15.800
I am sorry that this Canberra is so full of
Left Swadistana and if you allow these things

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.389
to continue I don’t know what will happen
to your government.

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:25.779
It will all go to dogs if this stupid thing
is allowed to work out because all those booths

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:30.170
will jump on all these civil servants and
serious things can happen.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:40.850
I am quite surprised how it is allowed in
Australia where is the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:46.970
As it is I am here now, I am sure something
will happen and they will give up that.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:53.589
But as far as coming to Sahaja Yoga, I would
say, it’s a headache.

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:58.620
You better give yourselves a bandhan before
touching them anywhere near because they will

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.079
give you lot of trouble.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.790
I have had lots of trouble with them.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.940
So much so, we had to leave one of our ashrams.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:12.900
You see, we had three persons in that ashram
from TM and they used to scream so much and

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.329
this jumping about was so much that the neighbors
told us that, ”You better get out from here”

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:20.230
and because of them we had to get out.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.759
All kinds of funny things they do.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:28.930
First time I saw these TM people, were in
a hall, and they took the first chairs.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.800
First row they were sitting there.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.190
As soon as I started speaking they all started
jumping like jack in the box.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.759
I was wondering, “What‘s the matter?

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.759
Is perfectly alright?

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:39.889
Who are these people?”

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.689
I had never seen such a thing before.

00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:46.860
I was quite surprised that who are these people
jumping like this one by one.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:52.230
Then I asked them, they said, “We do TM
and we are doing siddha course.”

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.230
“Siddha course?

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.800
Stupid people you are, that’s what you are.”

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:04.089
And out of these 6 or 7 people who were jumping
we could save about, I should say, two or

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:05.089
three.

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:08.970
So, those people who have gone to that you
shouldn’t worry so much about them.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.060
But, of course, if it is gone to the government
it is better to beat the government with shoes

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.509
and give bandhan to the government so that
they don’t get entangled with it.

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:24.879
But is serious thing and I have to work it
out myself on those lines because I was quite

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:30.399
shocked that in Canberra they have such bad
vibrations.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:36.130
I came to Canberra much before with my husband
and I told him that “The vibrations here

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.559
are very, very bad.”

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.019
So he said, ”All the capital cities are
like that.”

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:46.569
I said, “But it seems rather funny that
both the centers are catching so badly.”

00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:51.619
And I couldn’t walk that time also and today
also the same thing happened to Me.

00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:56.610
Now, we have many other people who are seeking
God.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.380
They live in the villages.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:05.040
These people have not gone to the villages
because they wanted only rich people, monied

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040
people.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.430
So, there are many people in the villages
who haven’t yet received their Self-Realization

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.439
and they can receive their Self-Realization
without any difficulties.

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:22.089
You can go there and talk to them and get
them realized because they are not people

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:29.319
for whom these rakshashas are waiting.

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:31.410
We have to give them realization.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.589
Once you give realization to people in the
villages, things will change.

00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:40.160
The atmosphere will change and you find lots
of people coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.089
So, I would say, I am very happy that in Sydney
itself we have so many centers and in other

00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:47.959
cities you have so many centers.

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:50.870
But now we have to reach the villages and
see them.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:57.929
They are innocent, simple people living in
the villages in a very simple manner and is

00:15:57.929 --> 00:16:07.740
better to give them proper attention because
they are the ones who will get realization.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.639
Then the children, children should be attended
to.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:18.429
They can be very nicely brought to Sahaj and
because there may be many of them who are

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:20.050
already born realized.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.870
So the children can be brought into Sahaja
Yoga but not without the permission of their

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:30.550
parents because the laws and regulations are
such that we may land up in the prison without

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.850
asking the permission of the father or mother.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.850
So, one has to be very careful.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:44.869
The another are the adolescent boys and girls
who are studying in the colleges and who are

00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:48.369
not yet exposed so much to all these bad things.

00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:54.089
They might be drug addicts little bit or may
be other addiction they might be having but

00:16:54.089 --> 00:17:00.600
they are not yet touched by these horrible
evil forces.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.250
So, you can just attend to them.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:11.080
You can also advertise that you can look after
people who are addicted to all these drugs

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.080
and all that.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.650
You can relieve them.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:20.430
If you are allowed to do that you can advertise,
get those people and if you give them realization

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.430
they might be able to get over their addiction
completely.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:31.680
There is a doctor, Dr. Wells, in London who
has now become a very big doctor in charge

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680
of a hospital of addiction.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.640
So, I said, “What do you do to them?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.520
How do you manage this addiction business?”

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.770
He said, “In their absence I beat them with
shoes, that’s all and they are all getting

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.040
rid of their addiction.”

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:52.830
So, you can attend to those boys who are now
grown up boys and are taking to drugs and

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.830
things like that.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.830
They are seekers.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.570
That’s why they are going to these things.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.400
I think this kind of an attitude if you have
that you are not going to attend to people

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.930
who are already with some gurus and with something
and encounter them.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:15.440
But attend to people who by their innocence
have fallen into some problems or to the innocent

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.210
people in the villages or children who are
innocent.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.690
I am sure you can prosper faster.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:29.110
So, Sahaja Yoga is growing very much faster
here and in a way in a city it is growing.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:35.160
We can grow much faster, I think, the way
there are people, so many people, are in the

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.320
villages and in the countryside; in a very
simple way they live.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:48.660
As for Myself, to come to Australia is such
an excitement and such a joy because last

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:55.130
year I could not come and this year when they
said it was a Sahastrar Puja and had to perform

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.970
here and be there, I was very happy.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:07.030
Tomorrow we have to have that Puja.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:14.030
I was also a person in a way you can say,
a seeker, because I was trying to find out

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:19.150
a method, the way, by which I could really
give en-masse realization.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:28.290
I could give realization to many people at
the same time and for that I was really working

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:34.370
very, very hard, understanding lots of people,
human beings, and out of them I found bureaucrats

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.290
are the worse.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:42.880
As you have lots of bureaucrats in this Canberra,
may be, that they are not so good because

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.980
they have to compromise all the time.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:52.890
They have to say, “Yes sir, yes sir,”
and despite their resistance, despite their

00:19:52.890 --> 00:20:06.650
not liking, to say that, they are poor things,
pushed into a job where they have to work

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.670
it out because after all job is important.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:15.780
When all these things become important, the
person’s personality suffers a lot.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:24.750
That’s what I found that the bureaucrats
who are seeking all the time power, go after

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.680
the man who can give them some more power,
in the sense the power not of the divine but

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.310
over the people that they can dominate more
people and they can manage more people.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:40.630
And that’s why these people fall into these
groups because in the beginning they feel

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:46.990
relaxed in a way and they dominate many people
as there are booths sitting with them who

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.990
give them ideas.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:52.340
But then they get tired of them and then they
fall sick.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.490
So, many people commit suicide also, suicide.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:04.290
I was told that suicide is maximum, suicide
cases are maximum in Canberra.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:09.450
The reason is this only that you don’t know
what to do with yourself.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.350
You suffer from some sort of a miserable disease.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:18.350
You don’t know how to get out of it and
then you commit suicide.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:28.620
So, all these things are connected with the
attack of the evil forces and these evil forces

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.560
attack you in a very subtle manner.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.300
So, one should be careful as to mature.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.830
One has to mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing
can affect them, nothing can trouble them,

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.960
nothing can bother them.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.570
One has to mature.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.990
The maturity should be such as like Mine.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:54.850
If I catch it, I mean, I deliberately catch
it and then I try to solve the problem.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:00.410
But if you cannot do that then you should
not catch also because you will suffer little

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.590
bit by catching them.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.850
Now, for tomorrow’s puja I hope you will
all be ready and you will all enjoy tomorrow’s

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.850
puja.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.360
Had a very nice puja in Pune which I had to
perform on the thirteenth because it is the

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:21.720
date called Akshaya Thrithya, means undestructible
third day of the moon.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.760
That’s actually nobody knew, but it is the
puja of the Kundalini.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.420
That day everybody felt very, very clear.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.100
Very clear.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:38.920
Puja was hardly for about half an hour, the
real puja of the Kundalini.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.880
But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:49.150
So, that sort of puja we should do tomorrow
also, if possible, so that we’ll have the

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:58.660
feelings of Sahastrara completely opened out
because even if Sahastrara is opened, the

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.970
rest of the chakras, if they are caught up
then you have problems.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.451
It’s better to clear out all the chakras
and then the Sahastrara.

00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.560
So, tomorrow we’ll do the puja in that fashion
and I hope it will work out very well for

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.560
all of you.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:24.680
I hope I have been rather late for all of
you and I am not taking too much of your time

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.680
here.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:36.390
Tomorrow I think it should be, you see, actually
you’ll be surprised that this is the time

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.540
I opened the Sahastrara in India.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:50.740
This is exactly the time because just now
is 6.30 there, 6.35 and about 6.30, I opened

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.740
Sahastrara.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:24:18.120
So, you can imagine this is the time I opened
the Sahastrara there and 

00:24:18.120 --> 00:30:15.100
this is the time we are sitting on 

00:30:15.100 --> 00:31:07.210
the other side of the world and celebrating
that day, that great day 

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:23.390
of Sahastrara being opened out.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:32:05.660
It’s a very great day in the history of
spirituality, very great day for the whole

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:15.230
world.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:52.700
They will realize one day what 

00:32:52.700 --> 00:33:00.420
it was.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:32.120
Such a big time that Sahastrara could 

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:55.670
be opened for masses.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:35:37.730
Not only that but you are empowered to do
that great work.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:36:36.190
May God bless you.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.549
Try to Become Aware

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.549
Shrirampur, India, 21 December 1989

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.549
…. Backwards, those who haven’t got space
please move backwards.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:18.549
Be sensible.

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:19.549
You all can see Me very well and those who
are far away are closer to Me; is a fact.

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:20.549
When I say the truth, the Vishnumaya is there.

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:21.549
Please be seated.

00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:22.549
Hello.

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:23.549
Uska kya naam?

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:24.549
Jenny, you go that side.

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:25.549
Don’t sit with men.

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:26.549
Must keep a discipline on yourself.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:27.549
Those who are sitting here please move to
the left.

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:28.549
Keep a distance.

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:29.549
Now, you are such great Sahaja Yogis, ancient
Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:30.549
People look forward to you for discipline
and sense.

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:31.549
Mostly those who are very new try to come
forward.

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:32.549
I’ve seen that.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.549
I can understand if you are a leader if you
are sitting in front.

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:34.549
But otherwise what is the need to sit in front?

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:35.549
Good.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:36.549
Please be seated.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:37.549
The further you are, you will feel more vibrations.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:38.549
You can; for this you can testify.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:39.549
The closer you are you’ll feel less.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:40.549
That’s My trick.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:41.549
[Hindi]

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.549
Now see, are you feeling more vibrations there?

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:43.549
Jenny, there, see yourself.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:44.549
All right?

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:45.549
I never tell lies.

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:46.549
I’ll have some water.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:47.549
[Hindi] No, no, why don’t you have a proper
seat?

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:48.549
[Hindi] You better have a seat.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.549
[Hindi] I’ve been telling them about something
which you need not know.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.549
I hope you didn’t understand.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.549
Sometimes I have to speak in English when
I want them not to know anything about you.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:52.549
It’s quite mutual.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:53.549
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.549
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:55.549
Otherwise I would never have taken you down
there for any problem because actually this

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:56.549
is the one that’s also a problem.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:14.399
God willing Me, we may buy this place.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:23.410
So I must praise you for your patience and
for your sweetness about it that delays do

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.720
not matter as long as we have the Pujas.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.509
I hope you all have rested very well and your
stomach must be also resting a little bit

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.080
because you had a very severe type of an attack
of people who wanted to feed you and it was

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
too much starting from Aurangabad to this
place.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.170
This is good once in a while to allow your
stomach to rest.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.210
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.810
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.390
to expand Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.069
It’s not necessary how many things you give
Me.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.750
It’s not necessary at all.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.980
It’s not necessary how many of us are there.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.750
What's more important is how many people you
give realization to.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.480
And secondly, how are you?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.400
Have you evolved?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.430
Have you really become independent and you
can get rid of all your conditionings, your

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.430
ego?

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
And have you become a very mild, beautiful,
compassionate, collective personality?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.830
So it’s a question of introspection, seeing
ourselves.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.670
It’s very important.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.640
If we do not have a proper car we cannot drive.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.810
In the same way if our being is in a funny
situation then you cannot ascend; that’s

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.810
a fact.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:22.600
So we have to understand that the amount we
enjoy everything is the sign how much we have

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.840
achieved.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.440
If there’s a little cup then a very little
joy can go into it.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.550
But if there’s a large cup it gets much
more joy in it.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.320
But if it is like an ocean all the rivers
of joys fall into it.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.630
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.660
Not fun, I mean enjoyment.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.380
I’m not saying frivolousness, cheapishness,
but a very majestic, deep enjoyment that you

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.880
have within yourself, which just bubbles into
you, makes you very happy, and you don’t

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.790
know why you are happy, just enjoying your
happiness.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.860
Then one has to say that you have really become
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.000
And then, at that stage you want to share
it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.569
Don’t you keep it to yourself.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.099
You’ll work very hard, do everything that
is possible under the sun.

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:25.520
Your mind will think how to spread it, how
to give this joy to others.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.930
You won’t be happy unless and until you
communicate with others.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.889
So first you become the capitalist and then
you become a communist.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.840
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.169
Second is what have we got in our mind now,
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.949
First, the light has to improve and automatically
the light has to spread.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.810
What is the relationships we have with ourselves,
which I have told you before also, don’t

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.810
form groups.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.680
This is the country; that is the country.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.259
I would request you to change the buses and
put different people into the buses and let

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:20.300
us see if they reach in one piece or not or
there is a big quarrel and a fight.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.870
If there is any quarrel or argument then drop
that person on the way and let him come by

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.479
another bus.

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:37.020
We don’t want argumentative spoiled sports
with us.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.909
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.370
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.879
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.819
Some bus will be coming and take you.”

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.539
So try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.770
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.620
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.509
You can move your body but not the neck.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.500
Neck should be moved with the body.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.460
Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.680
Then I thought you all have livers.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.599
But then it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must
have come from the way you people move your

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:21.599
neck.

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.710
Like if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.360
Or if you don’t want to say also, if I’m
saying anything you’ll go on like this,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360
nodding.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360
So don’t do all these things.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360
That spoils your Vishuddhi.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.779
As it is you have bad Vishuddhis, thanks to
this Roman Catholic Church and the other church

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.139
which just talks.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:49.080
So please try to keep your neck in line with
your body all the time and even if you have

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.240
to move, move very slightly your neck, not
with jerks, and don’t go on nodding.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.721
While music time I’ve seen many people do
not move their body.

00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:03.800
But if you see the Indians, they move their
body.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.869
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:08.979
be all right.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.389
There should be no problem on your Vishuddhis.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:17.729
For liver also, there are some people I see
still with liver who are very thin people.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:28.319
They should be asked to stand in the water
for one hour and clear out themselves.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.789
If you are very thin, be sure it is not a
normal thing.

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.800
It is not natural.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.509
It is abnormal to be very thin.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:42.520
So work it out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and
later on you can have a session of checking

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.729
yourselves somewhere sitting.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:49.279
Before meditation you can check yourselves
what is wrong with you before My photograph

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.039
and then you should go into meditation.

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:56.711
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness.

00:07:56.711 --> 00:08:01.809
Awareness is the main point, you should be
absolutely aware.

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:10.270
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this
is wrong road.”

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.610
They said, “How do you know Mother?”

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.699
I said, “Just I know.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:16.559
Just find out.”

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:21.610
Just to know everything you need not do anything
about it.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.129
But that is the sign that you have become
very aware.

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:32.860
To be aware of everything, it is not like
sitting down here that you should say, “Oh,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.250
it’s very beautiful.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.110
Oh, it’s very grand.”

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.350
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.630
Feel it in the atmosphere.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:52.570
Because we have a very big brain and we have
two loops in our head, is not one brain but

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.709
two loops.

00:08:53.709 --> 00:09:03.870
And when the awareness starts giving you light
you start knowing within yourself everything

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.920
and you are silent.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:17.220
You don’t have to assert, manipulate or
to exert yourself but just to know.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.300
And that’s a very beautiful thing one has
to do.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:28.000
Those people who do not feel vibrations must
feel their vibrations in these two.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.399
They have to feel their vibrations in these
two.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:39.569
And those who are still complaining about
their troubles and stomachs and livers and

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:51.060
this and that should get treated immediately
and get well.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.509
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:00.050
you properly because they think you are all
beggars.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.560
Only the beggars have hair like this.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.600
Please put oil and make your hair properly.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.019
They’ll not have any respect for you.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:13.160
You must have properly combed hair, groomed
hair.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.829
Otherwise they think you are something mad,
or you are hippies or something gone wrong

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:17.829
with you.

00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:20.100
They don’t appreciate this fashion.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:27.079
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:33.069
When we saw your western pictures when we
were young, they all were very well-groomed

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:34.069
people.

00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:40.470
Now suddenly this fashion stupid has come
to make you all bald-headed and then to sell

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.769
their ‒ what you call them ‒ wigs.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.529
So this stupid idea is wrong.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:54.050
Will you please now see that your hair are
properly groomed and not to have any hair

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.199
on your, this thing.

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:59.860
It’s a sign of stupidity in this country.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.700
Anybody has, who has hair on the forehead
it’s a sign of stupidity.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:11.019
We call it as “giprya”.

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:13.050
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.399
She told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:22.550
“Giprya” means a person who gets mad or
lunatic as the hair, hair you see like that.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.579
At least we Sahaja Yogis should not follow
such stupid fashions.

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:29.660
They now take out hair like this, you see.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.779
I just don’t know, like moustaches coming
out of the head.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.300
You should be proud of your forehead.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.540
It’s the Ekadesha.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:50.510
You have to fight the whole world with this
Ekadesha of yours.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:57.740
So please see that you keep your forehead
absolutely open, hair properly done and oily.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.740
That will also soothe you.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.279
In the night you can put some oil and it will
soothe you.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:06.379
You’ll find it very much better; specially
for liver patient is very important.

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:11.050
They must put oil in their heads because they
are dried out people.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.610
There’s no fat in their hair and the hair
do not grow.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:21.399
They become immediately bald as soon as they
achieve twenty-five to thirty years of age.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:27.480
I don’t want to have bald-headed Sahaja
Yogis.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.970
Otherwise you’ll have to wear the [shadings]
like the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:41.029
If you make such clownish appearances I’m
worried about you because you don’t see

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:44.070
the point what I am trying to make.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:50.100
Look after your hair; it’s very important.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:13:01.089
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation.

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:04.459
Though we may sleep late I always get up at
four o’clock.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:07.000
Whatever time you may sleep, get up at four
o’clock, do your meditation.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.259
You can go after to sleep again.

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:14.120
But that’s the best time to get up, have
your baths, whatever way you want, or wash

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.889
yourself and just go for meditation.

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:19.639
And then you can sleep off again.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:22.930
That time you will find you will be quite
alert and awake.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.010
It’s not so difficult.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.100
You’ll all be awakened.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.639
I will awaken you.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:36.220
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.930
go off to sleep.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.649
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:47.610
But it is going to come out of you people.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.260
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.670
to write something yourself.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.700
You have to bring out what is Sahaj culture
is.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.230
You are already manifesting it without My
telling you now.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.300
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.970
tell you all these things into details.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:22.569
Also, try to judge where is your attention,
what are you doing about your attention.

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:26.100
All the time keep an attention on your attention.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.269
Where is my attention?

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:32.839
Mr. Attention, where are you lost?

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.449
And that will work out for you.

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:36.550
So now for today it’s sufficient.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:42.290
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.350
of your ears.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.430
It should go inside and you should record
it and whatever I am saying it’s very important.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.430
May God bless you all.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.430
[Hindi]

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.430
Will you please polish those things some time
and show them?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.430
All right.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.430
[Hindi]

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440
All the small children can come ‒ up to
ten years.

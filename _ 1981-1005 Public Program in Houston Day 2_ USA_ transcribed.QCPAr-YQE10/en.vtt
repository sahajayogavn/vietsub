00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:43.560
The Beauty That You 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.480
Are
October 5, 1981

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:07.180
Public Program, Houston, Texas, USA

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:22.590
Yesterday I told you that God has created
us with a purpose and unless and until we

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.490
find out our purpose, unless and until we
find out our absolute, we are going to seek

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.160
and we are not going to be happy.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.670
He has done everything, very beautifully.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.620
Now we should understand what are we really,
inside.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.960
Moreover, as I explained to you yesterday,
that whatever I say is to be taken as a hypothesis,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.720
as a scientist who would keep his mind open
and see for himself, because everything is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.390
not known to you.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.780
And whatever I say, you have to keep your
mind open, you need not accept Me blindly

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.000
because blind faith is of no use.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.440
But, if you get your enlightenment, you get
your Self-realization, you actualize it, you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.770
become, then you have to verify for yourself
whatever I say, is it true or not?

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.760
For example, if I say that the Christ, our
Lord, is placed in this center of ours, at

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.320
the Agnya Chakra, which I’ll explain to
you in details.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:49.170
You are not to believe Me that He’s placed
there, but you have to see for yourself when

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.770
you get your realization, you will be able
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.770
And when you start raising the Kundalini you
will find that it will stop at this point

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.570
– because you will become your own gurus,
the Kundalini will move at your fingers, and

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.960
then when you find the Kundalini has stopped
here you’ll be amazed that you will have

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.370
to ask the seeker or the subject to say the
Lord’s Prayer.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.960
And that’s the only way you can get out
the Kundalini from that center.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.990
It’s a mantra.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.740
It’s a mantra, it’s a chanting, which
was given to us.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.350
He could have given the bija mantra, the seed
of that chanting is Ham-ksham.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.090
But, He didn’t give because He thought people
would be, specially Christians would be very

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.410
rational people, so He thought better give
a complete explanation of the whole thing.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.590
But every word of it is a mantra.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.120
But it is to be awakened; if it is not awakened,
it’s dead.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.570
It is to be awakened, this is the basis of
Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.760
“Saha” is “born.”

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.960
With you, Saha-ja.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.420
“Ja” means “born” and “Saha” is
“with” – is born with you, spontaneous,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.890
it’s living process within you, is your
own right, you must have it.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:18.860
So this is a living process and the living
happening should take place.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.760
You should become your absolute; you should
become your own guru; you should get complete

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.690
integration within yourself; and then you
will be able to discriminate because the all-pervading

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.840
Power, about which I told you yesterday, is
surrounding, is everywhere, only you are to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.060
be awakened; once you are awakened you can
start feeling them, the existence of that,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.870
around you, on your fingers.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.260
Imagine on your fingers you start feeling
that Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:05.370
That should happen to all of us and the time
has come, the blossom time has come and thousands

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.280
must get their realization.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.380
With this today I would explain to you the
different centers we have within ourselves

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.900
and the chakras that are within us.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.090
I was amazed, in New York they said that people
are taking lot of money for this chakra therapy,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.680
I mean I just can’t understand what they
do about it, but all those who came from this

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.740
chakra therapies, had all their chakras ruined
completely.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.810
I mean, you pay to ruin your chakras, I just
couldn’t understand.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.580
Anybody coming from India is not a saint,
on the contrary, as I told you, there could

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.639
be greatest thuggery in India.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.639
Yes.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.480
They are very intelligent, cunning people,
they can be very good.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:57.940
If they are good, they are very, very good
and if they are bad, they are horrid.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:06.500
So you have to be careful when you think of
an Indian that, as we cannot say that all

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.900
Americans are Mr. Ford, in the same way Indians
also, you must know how to discriminate.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.760
First of all your discrimination power must
come, otherwise you won’t be able to make

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.320
out who is the real, who is not the real.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.530
That must happen to you.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:32.360
Unless and until that happens the rest of
it is, is of no use, because as I said this

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.180
room is dark and your eyes are closed, when
you come inside you see nothing but darkness

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.900
and I start telling you, “this is this,
this is this and I tell you there’s one

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.400
elephant you can’t see here and there’s
one tiger sitting here,” you just believe

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
it.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.250
And there’s nothing like that here.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:55.340
And you people are definitely much more honest
that you can’t believe how people could

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.380
be such fake.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.960
Oh, there can be fake people all over the
world.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:10.250
I am ashamed of it sometimes when I see that
in the great country of yoga, where such great

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:19.020
incarnations came in, such great work of the
saints has been done, horrible people also

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:27.620
are born in the same place because that’s
the place they want to harm, they want to

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
attack.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.960
They are negative, not only negative but they
are very, very dangerous.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.199
I may tell about them tomorrow or day after,
but today I want to tell you about the good

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.390
things that you are.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.229
The beauty that you are and how beautifully
you are made within yourself.

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:51.200
So within us, as I told you, lies this residual
power called as Kundalini.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:58.410
This is the part of the all-pervading Power
which thinks, which understands, which coordinates,

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.410
which loves.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:06.720
Is the integration of all these powers within
us, as this Kundalini.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.730
Now so many books have been written about
Kundalini.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:18.579
When I read them I was shocked that how could
people write books about Kundalini without

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:24.882
understanding what it meant, without understanding
where it was.

00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:25.882
Such big books have been written on Kundalini,
which says, “The Kundalini is in the stomach,

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:30.690
some say this Kundalini’s in the nose.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.690
I don’t know how could people write, I mean
it takes nothing for them to write something

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:40.700
and to publish, and they are not afraid of
God that they are writing all these nonsensical

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.750
things without understanding it.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:51.000
So this is the Kundalini that is placed in
the sacrum bone.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.140
Now this bone, even in English is called as
sacrum, this word comes from Greece as I told

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.439
you that Greek people knew about Kundalini.

00:09:57.439 --> 00:10:00.459
Sacrum means sacred.

00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:03.780
This bone is a sacred bone.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:10.600
And why is it a sacred bone because the Kundalini,
the primordial desire within us to be one

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.800
with the Divine, is still unmanifested and
sleeping, and is the safest place where it

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.800
has to be.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:24.090
Now you are paying attention to Me, now if
I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.530
You may say, “I’m paying attention,”
but you cannot, you cannot take your attention

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.530
inside.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.660
But if there is some happening within you,
then your attention is drawn inside, so it

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:41.650
is built like this that at a human level this
happening will take place of sprouting.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.589
And when this sprouting takes place, then
your attention is pulled inside.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:53.370
This attention has gone out because of the
prismatic, as you say the prism here, prismatic

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.440
action of the brain of a human being.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:04.820
I will not go into the details of it, but
there is a big science about that: why our

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.199
attention is outside all the time.

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:14.010
Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half
coils, is placed a very important center of

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.459
innocence, is the center of innocence.

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:23.460
The first thing that was emitted out of the
all-pervading Power was, it had the form,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:29.950
I should say the all-pervading Power was nothing
but just innocence, which is the most powerful

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.830
thing in this world, is your innocence.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:42.470
And this innocence is placed below the Kundalini,
and is adorned by the deity called as Shri

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.950
Ganesha, who has a trunk like an elephant.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.880
This is the bija; this is the seed of Christ.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.670
This forms the seed, and then He incarnated
on this earth, this is the subtle form, on

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:06.650
this earth as Mahavishnu – is written down
in the Devi Purana – or we call Him as Christ.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:12.020
The name Christ and His name Jesus also has
a very big meaning and relates to something

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.080
that happened before Him.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:22.030
Now this great incarnation of Christ came
on this earth, which was nothing but innocence,

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:30.080
innocence itself took the form and it was
the all-pervading Power itself which took

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.230
the form and came on this earth.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.450
That’s why this is a very important center,
is the beginning.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:47.170
Because it is innocence, is like a lotus and
it is placed at a point where the gate to

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.090
hell are open within us.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:58.050
This center gives rise in the gross … Now
this is a subtle center called as Mooladhara

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.050
Chakra.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.050
Chakra Mooladhara.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.439
Mooladhara means the support of the root.

00:13:02.439 --> 00:13:04.559
Now root is the Kundalini.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.020
It is the support of the root.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.970
Kundalini is the Mother, and this is your
innocence, this is your childhood and that’s

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:13.970
the Mother.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:24.520
And the Mother is there to give you your realization,
waiting all the time, She is your own individual

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.370
Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together,
to give you the experience of Self-realization,

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.780
to give you your second birth.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:41.320
Now the last center looks after, in the gross,
the Pelvic Plexus, which you have heard of,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:50.089
which has also got four sub-plexuses, this
has also got four petals as we call it.

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:52.290
There are four petals.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:14:00.290
So this center looks after the pelvic plexus
in the gross, which looks after the excretion.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:08.069
This center we must consider at length, a
little bit, which is very important to understand

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:13.800
that this also looks after the sex and reproduction,
mainly the sex and other excretions.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:22.660
Now you can see here that it is placed below
the Kundalini.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.930
That means sex does not play any part in your
evolution.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.530
It does not.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:34.750
Those people who say that sex has something
to do with Kundalini, are really blasphemous

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:42.299
and very ugly people because you cannot put
sex to your Mother.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:47.709
It’s something, even today is not accepted,
when people have become so much lenient about

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:49.500
sex, is not accepted.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.400
And this is what it is when people talk of
sex and Kundalini together.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:02.790
As a Mother, I give them a little chance or
sort of a little grace because to say that

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:09.040
they originated all this from deliberate action
will be too much.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.870
I would say that maybe they when they were
meditating, at the sex point they might have

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.220
seen Ganesha’s trunk which they might have
thought to be the Kundalini.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.520
Possibly that’s how they went into a wrong
situation.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.709
But of course it’s a very wrong thing.

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:32.089
We have had cases in New York and here also
where the private parts of people were touched

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:38.270
by some of the people, and are having a very
bad time with that action.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.130
It’s your private.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.800
It has nothing to do with sex.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.890
Animals are more sex-conscious than you are;
are they going to get evolution before you

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.890
get?

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:57.690
Moreover, the whole thing that is worked out
in such a way that we have started having

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.790
the sex through our mental activity, which
is a wrong thing.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.520
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adultery,
thy should not commit adultery.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:15.500
But I say, I say verily to you, ‘Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes.’

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:23.530
Because He knew this would happen one day
that the sex would move from there to the

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:30.250
Swadisthana Chakra – the second chakra by
which we think – and then it will come into

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.370
our thinking and our eyes will start roving
around.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:42.460
And then, actually the sex act minimizes,
and it becomes a big problem; I mean to be

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.699
a sex point itself becomes an achievement
for people then.

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:48.140
It’s such an absurd thing to do.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.980
And this is what is a very big confusion today
in the modern times.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.630
I mean, you cannot make compromises with Christ;
what He said is absolute.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:07.419
But unless and until you understand that sex
as a married life, as a private thing, is

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:16.860
the one that has been sanctioned for our sustenance,
for our sustenance as human beings; that has

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:23.800
to be looked after, is to be respected, is
sacred.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.390
And that’s why anything else that we try
to do, all kinds of perversions and these

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:35.140
things – you won’t believe that all kinds
of perversions come to us because we are no

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.180
more there.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.830
Mostly we get possessed.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:46.160
We had one boy who came to us in New York
and he told me, “Mother, I…

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.620
I’m a man, I have moustaches and everything
but I want to be like a woman.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.780
I want to be dressed up like a woman,” and
he talked like a woman.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.350
He said, “I want to walk like a woman, I
don’t know what to do with myself.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.630
I am so confused.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:05.170
And I cannot have any relationship with any
woman because she gets confused with me also.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.940
And I don’t know what is happening to me,
why I want to be like this.”

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.550
And I could see he was possessed by a woman.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.990
He was just possessed by a woman, simple thing
as that.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.710
Very simple, it is extremely simple.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:27.200
And when that possession was removed, he said,
“I am a man again.”

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.060
Is so simple, in one day.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:36.510
He is a different man altogether today, absolutely
a different personality, and it can happen

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.270
to a woman.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:44.650
We had somebody from Australia and she got
possessed by a man and she started talking

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.260
like that and behavior, the whole thing, her
husband got frightened, and he couldn’t

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.670
understand what’s gone wrong with this lady.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:57.710
And the whole attitude, the whole beauty of
a woman was lost into the style of a man,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.310
and it was so funny and odd to look at.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.880
Same thing: she came to Sahaj Yoga and the
spirit ran away.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.430
She is a beautiful woman now, extremely beautiful,
and they’re having a very good relationship.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:19.180
So when you try to do anything perverted with
the sex and do not respect it, you do not

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.800
know what things are awaiting us around.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:28.670
So before I go to other chakras, I want to
tell you about our other unknown areas which

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.960
are very important to us and then we’ll
go to the second chakra.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.230
As you see here on the left hand side this
blue line is there.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:49.519
This blue line is our power of desire by which
we desire, by which God has – supposing

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:53.230
this is the primordial being because God has
made you in His own image – supposing it

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.520
is the image of God, then it is His desire.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:05.470
This power of desire gives you existence,
and when this desire is over, when the Spirit,

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:12.670
which is watching the drama of this body,
gets fed up, it disappears, then the death

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.170
comes in.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.730
This power of desire is the left side.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:25.310
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi, also called
as the Moon Nadi and in the Hatha Yoga is

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.440
the Tha Nadi.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.250
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:35.620
But this gives rise to the gross channel,
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.420
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and
right sympathetic nervous systems are two

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.940
different, but you will find out yourself
that they are very different.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:52.380
This looks after our emotional side, and also
beyond this lies the area which is unknown

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.810
to us, is the subconscious; it is unknown
to us.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.890
Whatever is unknown is not God, is not from
God’s area.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:06.640
It is an unknown area, and beyond that subconscious
area, lies the collective subconscious – all

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.870
that has died from our creation.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:22.721
Recently I was seeing one of the series on
cancer, in London on the television, and they

00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:29.050
told that they have discovered some sort of
proteins, which they call as protein 58 and

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:39.330
56 and all that, they have given names, which
they have also photographed – enter into

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:47.580
our being from areas which are built within
us, from unknown areas – they do not know

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.860
if they are known areas – which are built
within us since our creation.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.290
Now, I’ve told this about ten years back
in America before.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.160
And they trigger the happening of cancer,
they trigger it.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:05.520
So it is from the collective subconscious
this attack comes in.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.370
So if you move to the left side, you move
to the collective subconscious too much and

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.180
then all kinds of things can happen to you.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:22.060
For example, first of all you start getting
shaking, you start hearing voices, you start

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.350
feeling that you are losing your body; you
are going on top of some place and seeing

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.350
things.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.560
Is all these spirits are doing.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.990
Now it has reached such a serious state, that
in Switzerland I found that many children

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.740
were killed because of this action.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:48.350
The mother is, supposing, with some clairvoyant
lady or somebody who is doing this spiritual

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.350
work.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.350
Is a very dangerous thing.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.110
One should never take to this kind of a thing.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.820
If you take to these things, then seven generations
suffer.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.680
Today only I had a girl who told Me that her
mother was a clairvoyant, and all her life

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.430
she was miserable with her husband and this
girl has been always crying and weeping and

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.180
she cannot conceive or something like that.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.680
Is a very serious thing, one should never
go into these unknown areas of the collective

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.790
subconscious and worry about the dead and
control them and look after them and call

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.790
them.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.330
You must give them their freedom.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.190
Is a very dangerous area into which you enter.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.200
I hope you don’t mind it, I have to tell
you the truth, I am your Mother, and I have

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.870
to tell you the truth: that you should be
very careful about this kind of thing like

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:41.390
psychics or the people who try to say that
“You can get possessed.”

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.800
They will not say, they say, “It is, it
is–” They can even say, “This is Holy

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800
Ghost.”

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.120
They can say anything.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.860
But in whatever way, when you find that you
are not in control of the situation, that

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.680
means you are not there.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.410
Is very simple as that, supposing your car
is driving and suddenly it goes into a khadd

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.620
[pit – ED.].

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.680
Now, do you think that you have achieved a
greater progress by that?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.440
It’s just you have moved without your control.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.799
If you have no control upon yourself …If
somebody sitting down and he starts jumping

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:23.990
– automatically, he cannot control his jumping
– then it is not himself, minimum of minimum.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.290
Whatever he is, even that control is lost.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:35.150
Anything, any such happening which is beyond
your control means that you are enslaved by

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.160
one of these possessions.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.660
But they are never satisfied with what they
do to you.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.580
I mean like I’ll tell you one of the very
startling example of this left side.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:51.440
In London we have – I don’t know now if
they have but we had – a center called,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.170
“Late Dr. Laing’s International Curative
Center.”

00:24:54.170 --> 00:25:01.530
I didn’t know about it, but a lady came
to Me in India to tell Me about this.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:08.170
She said she had some problem with her stomach
and she wrote to this organization saying

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.310
that “Please, help me to get cured.”

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.470
And they wrote back saying that “At five
o’clock on such-and-such date, we’ll enter

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.470
into your body.”

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.000
I mean they were honest, I must say, as English
people are honest sometimes.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.400
So he was honest to say that “We’ll enter
into your body, some of the doctors are there

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.710
who will enter into your body, and they’ll
cure you.”

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:35.460
But afterwards, after five years the lady
was rattling, rattling just like a junkie

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.460
car.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.950
And she came to Me and then she gave Me the
history of this, which I verified.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:47.270
The Dr. Laing, the Dr. Laing, the one, the
one who is the one who is supposed to be running,

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.190
is late, he’s dead.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:58.580
He entered into a soldier in Vietnam, an American,
and told him that “You go and talk to my

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.210
son and tell him that I have entered into
you and that you should start such and such

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.210
organization.”

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:10.070
Now this soldier has never done anything,
I mean he has never seen a scalpel also, he

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.420
doesn’t know how to operate, no question.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.460
This soldier went to the son and told him,
and he told him certain secrets which convinced

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.470
the boy and they started that organization.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.210
This organization went on like this.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:32.110
And this soldier, of all the persons, used
to do the operation, you see it’s called

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.810
“psychic operation,” all sorts of things
and he had never seen anything and he used

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.640
to be possessed by this man and he did it.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.640
But why didn’t he go to his son directly?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.830
Because he knew about the dangers.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:55.600
And the same son will end up – I am sure,
hundred percent, the same gentleman who is

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.070
operating and the son – with some trouble,
which is of a very serious nature.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.110
Because never play with the fire which is
the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.470
You have to be in the present and not in the
past.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.150
Now the people who think too much about their
past, “What was my previous life?”

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.280
Why should you worry?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.190
Whatever it was is better today because you
can get realization today.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:23.620
You could not get realization even if you
were the King of Egypt, what does it matter?

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.320
You couldn’t get your realization that day,
so why worry about the past?

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.500
All the time worrying about the past or playing
with your emotions, you see.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.300
Like we had one gentleman, who used to always
cry and weep too much and his mother sent

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.330
him to Me, and I asked him, “What did you
do all your life?”

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.870
He said, “I was very fond of Lord Byron
and I just read him.”

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.170
I said, “All right, that’s it.”

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:52.800
This Lord Byron, he led such a horrible life
himself, an unholy person, and made everybody

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800
cry,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.390
“You suffer, you must suffer, you must weep.”

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.390
Why should you suffer?

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:06.280
The idea of a saint is that a person who is
absolutely in bones, walking like a TB patient,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.950
is a saint.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.180
I mean is something sadistic, I can’t see
Christ.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:15.130
I was so happy to see that you showed Him
as a resurrection, that is His message.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.270
Is resurrection is His message.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:23.690
Crucifixion is just a means but resurrection
is the thing.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.410
And the lanky-panky stuff, walking like a
saint, how can that be?

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:35.800
Is it possible, a person who is bestowed with
God’s blessing has to be a healthy, cheerful

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.210
and a very happy person, has to be that.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:44.380
Minimum of minimum should be that, and I was
happy to see even Mr. Paulsen here, who was

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.460
very healthy and this thing I said, “Now,
this is a religious place because wherever

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.820
I go I find such serious and absolutely sickly
people.”

00:28:51.820 --> 00:29:03.320
So the people who believe in sufferings, like…
the Jews they denied Christ.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.710
Why?

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.790
Because He was a Jew.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.960
Is absolutely true about human nature.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.420
If I was an American, you would not have accepted
Me.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:20.190
In India the Indian Christians, in whose community
I was born, have not accepted Me at all.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.380
Can you imagine?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:27.200
I have got Muslim disciples, Hindus, I’ve
got Parsis and Sikhs, but hardly one or two

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.250
and maybe My family people.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.270
They have not accepted Me.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.880
They didn’t accept Christ, and because they
didn’t accept they couldn’t accept that

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880
He suffered for us.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.220
Why should we suffer?

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.660
Has He suffered less for you any way: has
He left some for you to suffer?

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:46.800
So, you want to suffer, all right have Hitler
and suffer?

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.140
That’s it!

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.490
Have him!

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.520
If you enjoy suffering, why not?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.920
And it started like that.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.890
Actually when Hitler came, for eleven years,
you will be amazed, eleven years, these people

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.770
were supposed to be suffering you among themselves,
you see?

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:10.040
In France if you go today people are sitting
outside and they are talking of their sufferings

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.420
and money and other nonsensical things.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:17.730
They are waiting for the day, they said that
that in ‘82 in any case we are going to

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:22.240
be finished, waiting for– they discussing
it very nicely.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.059
Les Miserables I call them, as they are.

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:30.930
So why should you suffer, I just can’t understand,
when Christ has suffered for you?

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.010
Only He’s to be awakened within us.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:40.160
If He’s awakened, He takes away all our
sufferings, all our conditionings, all our

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.090
so-called karmas and everything, which I will
show you later on how it works out.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.040
So now we come to the left side then to the
right side.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.910
Right side is the action, the power of action,
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:06.700
When you want to enact your desire, manifest
it, then you use this action power, Iccha

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.940
Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:14.470
Now this power works mainly through this second
center, or we call it the third center, actually

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.160
it is the third because the second one is
that.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:26.480
This center is called as Swadisthana and this
center has got six, you can see six plexuses,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.820
it’s like the Star of David.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:37.760
Moses preached something, and Jews are doing
something else.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.440
Christ preached something, and Christians
are doing something else.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.830
Adi Shankaracharya taught something, and Hindus
are doing just the opposite.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.990
Mohammed taught something, and they did just
the opposite.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:55.050
It’s not only in religion, in every way
you see how we are perverted.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:05.620
Like this center is used for converting the
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.580
Nor do we realize that our brain is made of
fat.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.220
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.260
Now there’s a general principle in this
country that you should not use any butter,

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.760
which is very wrong.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.640
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.200
I mean where will you get, it’s completely
drained out.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:37.100
You use your brain so much, so much so, that
this poor center has to work only for your

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.790
thinking which has no productivity.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:43.980
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,
thinking; two horns come out of your head

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.380
of thinking; still you are thinking, and they
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:53.070
And what are you thinking, what have you got
out of your thinking?

00:32:53.070 --> 00:33:01.990
This right side is the one which is our five
elements also, five elements within us.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:11.160
So when we started discovering what is the
essence of the five elements, in India we

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:16.590
started the Vedas thousands of years back,
and the effect of that is shown now, is the

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.560
science, you discovered, the science.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.240
That you understood how to master these five
elements.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.880
But what did you do with it?

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.230
You created bombs; horrible bombs you have
created.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.820
You have created these devils and now you
are frightened of them.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.059
Thank God.

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:39.280
That’s something good that all such ventures
stop by themselves because you create a bomb,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.090
it becomes a devil on top of your head.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.900
Now you can’t start war because as soon
as you start means no more existence.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.090
So you are frightened and that is how – where
have we gone to?

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.570
Science has led us to which sensible things,
we should think.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:34:01.060
For example science has given us all these
devices by which our life can be made very

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.410
easy.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:07.480
We can have more time, we can have much more
time than our forefathers had, who had to

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.470
do everything with their own hands and go
about it, but here, you see, everything is

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:14.470
instant.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:15.730
I mean anything: You want to have food?

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.919
All right you have instant, everything is
made instant.

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:22.369
But for what is it instant, is to save time.

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:27.440
Now we have watches also here to save time,
everybody’s saving time, saving time, everybody

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.690
“busy” saving time.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.169
But what are you doing about the saved time?

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:33.169
What do we do with it?

00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:37.860
For example there was a gentleman coming from
India, very busy man, “Very busy, there’s

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.060
no time to talk to anyone.”

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:46.159
And I said, “Wanna, why are you in such
a great hurry to go?”

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.520
“Oh, you don’t know!

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520
I have very important –“

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.520
“What?”

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.639
“I have to attend a particular ball for
five hours there.”

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:52.639
“Very good.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.359
Is that the way you are going to save?”

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:59.660
“And then I have to attend a racecourse,
I have to do this, I have to do that.”

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.300
This is no saving of time; this is the real
waste of time.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.480
Real waste of time is this way we do it, and
how are we going to save our time?

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:15.940
Time is to be saved to be realized, to be
in meditation, to enjoy the beauties of God.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:21.400
That’s why these all things are given to
us, and that’s how we should look at them.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.450
But now we have become their slaves.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:30.520
When we achieve something, for example electricity,
it is so important to New York that one day

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.540
it stopped, the whole thing stopped.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.630
So we become also slaves to these.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.990
Apart from that, now we have no time, we are
so busy.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.990
I don’t know.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:44.279
I thought that here people will have more
time than we have in India because, you see,

00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:50.319
if you have to travel we have very funny trains,
and we have not yet developed as you people

00:35:50.319 --> 00:35:51.319
are.

00:35:51.319 --> 00:35:54.069
Sometimes I have to go to villages in bullock
carts and this and this.

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:56.079
But people have no time.

00:35:56.079 --> 00:36:01.049
This is the trouble in these countries, you
have no time at all and I don’t know what

00:36:01.049 --> 00:36:03.720
constructive work they are doing for themselves.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.390
So this is what is the right side where we
go wrong.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:11.369
But the worst thing we do is to think.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:17.869
We think all the time, and what do we think?

00:36:17.869 --> 00:36:20.890
Either we think of aggression or we think
of recession.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.160
For example we think that, “Oh, we are guilty.”

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.099
You do something and then you sit down, “Oh,
I should not have done it, this is very wrong

00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:37.170
I should not have done it,” and you start
wondering about it, correcting about it.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:43.130
But actual correction is not there, actual
correction is not there, only by thinking

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.910
you avoid the main issue.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:50.829
You have to be in the present but thinking
can only take you to the left or to the right,

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:52.239
to the past or to the present.

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:53.239
[future – ED?]

00:36:53.239 --> 00:36:58.550
You cannot be at the state where you become
just yourself, there’s no thought.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:03.720
There is no mental activity at all, you just
become.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.590
Because a thought rises like this and falls
off, another thought rises like that and falls

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.579
off, in between them is a very little space
which is the present.

00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:18.440
So the past comes to the future and becomes,
again the future comes in and again becomes

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.630
the past like that.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:25.010
But in between is the present and that present
is very small.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:30.980
Unless and until you know how to stay in that
present, you will be always tossing on these

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:37.349
waves of past and future while past is finished
and future doesn’t exist.

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:39.960
You plan out something, it – all plans goes
out.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.309
You plan anything but how can you plan also,
I can’t understand.

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:49.579
Supposing you don’t know the way, and you
plan that, “I will go right and left.”

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:52.069
Now supposing you are going to the right and
left is the sea, will you jump in the sea?

00:37:52.069 --> 00:38:00.619
Anything that you have to do new, you cannot
plan it out, you have to keep it just open,

00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:06.160
like a seed when it sprouts, it has got a
living cell at its tip.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.509
It goes and sees for itself how it has to
move.

00:38:10.509 --> 00:38:14.710
When there is hardness, it moves round the
hardness, when there is softness, it moves

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.710
like that.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:21.559
So when we plan everything we really become
rigid, and like – I heard of a person who

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:23.349
planned everything for his picnic.

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:29.470
He had all champagne and everything put together
and when he reached the place he had no bottle

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.180
opener and he had to break the bottles.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.910
That’s what it is.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.550
Sometimes the planning can be such a headache,
I mean, you waste one hour in planning and

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:43.009
while it comes to reality you find it’s
all wrong, it doesn’t work out.

00:38:43.009 --> 00:38:48.710
So too much planning, like I have to go supposing
to Los Angeles, I have to book My ticket,

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.089
this is today, I have to do it today.

00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:54.450
I don’t have to sit down and plan that on
such and such date I’ll go and book it.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.549
So in the present if you know how to live,
but this cannot be done by saying that “You

00:38:58.549 --> 00:38:59.549
live in present.”

00:38:59.549 --> 00:39:03.890
It cannot be done, I know because that’s
not some sort of a thing that can be taught.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:07.309
It has to happen to you, you have to become
that.

00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:12.079
Once you become that, then you become thoughtlessly
aware.

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:14.280
You become a witness.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.579
You see the whole show as a drama, and you
don’t get involved into it.

00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:20.589
You just see the waves coming up and going
down.

00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:26.900
Like, I can say, you are standing in the water,
and there are waves around and you are frightened,

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.510
but if you are put in the boat you start seeing
those things.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.819
If you know how to swim you can enjoy those
waves.

00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:39.880
In the same way when you become a master,
when you come in the boat in the state of

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.390
thoughtless awareness then you start seeing
these things and the whole thing appears like

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.390
a drama.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:49.160
Actually the whole thing is a drama but the
drama must end for you to see that it’s

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.079
just a drama and you are unnecessarily worried
about it, and by worry, you know for definite

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.349
nothing works out.

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:59.770
But if I say, “Don’t worry,” you’ll
worry more, that’s not the way.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.079
That’s not the way.

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:05.859
They all tried these tricks to say, “Don’t
do that and don’t do that,” it never worked.

00:40:05.859 --> 00:40:07.180
With human beings it doesn’t work out.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.079
It’s all right with animals, you can work
it out, but with human beings, if you tell

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:13.130
them, “Don’t,” they’ll do it ten time.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:16.890
So best is to so make them that.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:20.900
Unless and until they are made the spirit
it’s impossible to convince a modern man

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.269
to do something.

00:40:22.269 --> 00:40:28.599
So is best is first let them have their realization,
let them have their light, let them see for

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:32.130
themselves what’s the problem, let them
feel it and correct it.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.410
It’s let them judge themselves, that is
the best way is to do it, and that’s the

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:44.160
time has come for you to have it and see for
yourself and be able to discriminate between

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.270
false and reality.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:56.489
Now this side beyond is the supraconscious
area, and beyond this is the collective supraconscious.

00:40:56.489 --> 00:41:06.119
Now if you take LSD, for example you take
LSD, you go onto supraconscious area.

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:13.130
I was surprised when I went to Colombia, I
asked them, they had a condor as their emblem

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.619
for navy, and I said, “How condor is your
emblem?”

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:19.989
because condor has nothing to do with the
navy.

00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:27.049
They said, “Our old Indians have told us
that a God called Shri Vishnu,” just see

00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:29.160
the name, “came on a condor.”

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.900
And really condor is the conveyance of Vishnu.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.579
Can you imagine?

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:35.729
I was amazed at this.

00:41:35.729 --> 00:41:39.989
How did these people in thousands of years
backs saw, but then I said, “What were they

00:41:39.989 --> 00:41:42.440
doing normally, what was their pastime?”

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:52.279
And they showed Me a thing made out of a shell
of a fruit and with a little stirring rod

00:41:52.279 --> 00:41:53.789
in it.

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:54.799
I said, “What is this?”

00:41:54.799 --> 00:41:56.560
They said, “They used to make some sort
of a amrose.”

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.329
“Oh, I see, that’s it.”

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:03.869
And even today Peru is exporting that amrose
to you which is nothing but LSD.

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:09.760
If you take things like that, of that nature,
of LSD nature, you go to the right side.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.329
You move to your supraconscious area.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.400
Means you get disintegrated.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.099
In the morning I told you that when you are
integrated you don’t see any auras or anything

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:20.099
around the person.

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:23.910
When you are disintegrated, only then you
see because you become these five elements.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.450
When you are integrated you don’t see anything.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:33.359
And then you start seeing these things, like
an eye and a light, and all those things you

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:39.829
start seeing, and if you go further, further
with it into supraconscious areas, you can

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:45.359
become horribly possessed by the people who
have been ambitious.

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.809
Even Hitler can possess you.

00:42:47.809 --> 00:42:49.279
Hitler did that.

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:52.710
Hitler did all supraconscious activity in
Germany.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.200
How he possessed people was through supraconscious.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.200
Because in the supraconscious, collective
supraconscious, there are many ambitious people

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.339
who have died.

00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:08.210
Like Gauguin was an ambitious man, but he
became mad, I don’t know how he became mad.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.729
Normally an ambitious man doesn’t become
mad he makes everyone mad, but he doesn’t

00:43:12.729 --> 00:43:13.729
become himself.

00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:18.489
But this fellow was possessed, and we saw
it in the television that a man who was possessed

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:20.761
by this Gauguin was painting just like him.

00:43:20.761 --> 00:43:24.400
I know – you see Gauguin’s paintings,
that you must be knowing also that in one

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.470
line he puts lots of color and he was doing
it very fast.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.779
And he said, “I’m possessed by Gauguin.”

00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:35.630
So these ambitious people, like some of the
ambitious people could be doctors, could be

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:43.779
mathematicians, can be physicians or anything
like that, they can possess.

00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:50.730
I know of a lady, she is a unique mathematician
and she’s possessed, definitely possessed.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.739
And she can tell you anything you ask her,
any square root, anything she can tell you,

00:43:53.739 --> 00:43:58.170
and she’s earning lot of money out of it
but she’s always sick, she has a headache.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.410
She came to Me for curing, I said, “You
have to give up this nonsense.”

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.979
She said, “Let me make sufficient money,
then I’ll give up.”

00:44:03.979 --> 00:44:10.089
I said, “By that time I may not be there.”

00:44:10.089 --> 00:44:14.190
So these things can happen to you with the
supraconscious activity and this awareness

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.670
of supraconscious is also very dangerous.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:23.489
The trouble is if you suffer from the superego
there, from this side, with the conditionings,

00:44:23.489 --> 00:44:25.319
you suffer.

00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:30.319
I mean you get the pains all over the body,
you might feel sick, you will cry and weep,

00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:33.460
you’ll be unhappy, it troubles you.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.520
But when you are possessed by this ego business,
as it is ego is too much, and then if you

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:45.050
get possessed by somebody egoistical, then
God save that person and God save all the

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.610
relations, because such a person you cannot
even talk, he’s so aggressive, he’s so

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:57.950
aggressive, he will aggress all the other
people ultimately he himself becomes absolutely

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.239
stupid fool.

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:04.559
Many people whom we think are very successful
in life, really are stupid; if you look at

00:45:04.559 --> 00:45:06.220
them they are really stupid people.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:13.150
Like we can say, this Kennedy’s… a man,
what was his name is, whom she married –

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.150
Man: Onasis

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:18.190
Shri Mataji: He was a stupid fool, I have
met him.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.680
I met him; he was a real fool I tell you.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.660
I don’t know how this woman married him
and she must be another stupid fool to marry

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.660
him.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.660
Both must be foolish.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.809
Actually I met him very well, because My husband
is with the shipping, and I don’t know how

00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:35.869
could she marry this old man like her grandfather
and what was the thing?

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:41.390
Maybe money part or whatever it was, I mean
it’s so stupid, the whole thing is so stupid.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.650
And this stupidity you can see, even it grows
with your age more and more, and you become

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.880
more stupid.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.930
Like an eighty-year-old woman writing love
letters to an eighteen-year-old boy.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.930
It’s stupidity.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:57.740
Is absolute stupidity, I tell you, if you
see it from wisdom point of view.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.650
One can’t understand an old man, who is
like a great-grandfather, writing a love letter

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:07.930
to a little girl of eighteen years or an old
woman, who could be a great-great-great-grandmother

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:08.930
writing to a little boy like that, it’s
absurd.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:13.489
And they are so stupid and they talk like
this, “I believe in this.”

00:46:13.489 --> 00:46:19.200
Of course all the donkeys believe like that,
so there’s nothing new about it.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.190
But they are so starringly stupid that you
are amazed, you know.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:28.970
You start looking at them, “What’s the
matter with them?”

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:34.049
This is the blessing of this mister ego, which
exists in the head sometimes goes up like

00:46:34.049 --> 00:46:41.800
a balloon, but you start seeing it, you start
seeing it when you get your realization.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:51.050
I had a disciple, one of My sons, who came
to Me and one day he said, “Mother, I’m

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.050
really frightened with one idea.”

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.259
I Said, “What is it?”

00:46:53.259 --> 00:46:55.559
“But You don’t tell me if it is true.”

00:46:55.559 --> 00:46:56.829
I said, “What is it?”

00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:59.130
He said, “Was I Napoleon in my last life?”

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.170
I said, “What makes you think like that?”

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:05.609
“Because I can see such a big ego on my
head, this could be only Napoleon and I know

00:47:05.609 --> 00:47:06.609
how to draw.

00:47:06.609 --> 00:47:11.069
These two things put together, could I have
been Napoleon, but if I was You don’t tell

00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:14.630
me otherwise I may commit suicide” – even
after realization.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.589
So it is ego becomes then a headache to us.

00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:22.410
It becomes a headache and we want to get rid
of it.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:28.529
We start seeing it, and it presses you, you
get a headache and you feel it in the Agnya,

00:47:28.529 --> 00:47:30.970
how it troubles you.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.740
Then it starts troubling you – not others
so much as it troubles you – because you

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.589
don’t want to accept that you are egoistical,
you start seeing it.

00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:41.789
But you don’t say that you have a ego, you
will come and tell Me, “Mother I’ve got

00:47:41.789 --> 00:47:44.220
an Agnya catching,” and we have to clear
that Agnya.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.390
Nobody feels bad about it because you are
separated from yourself.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:53.029
You don’t feel that you are hurt or insulted
because you get separated, and you see for

00:47:53.029 --> 00:47:54.029
yourself.

00:47:54.029 --> 00:47:58.661
Like this sari has some sort of a black spot
on it, so I see it, I take it out, and then

00:47:58.661 --> 00:48:02.240
I want to wash it, I don’t want to keep
it black; I am not identified with it.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:07.640
So all these fixations also drop out when
you get realized, because you go in the center,

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.410
not on the left or to the right.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:19.940
Now movement on the right, actually is the
blessing of this center, in the center, because

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:27.319
the central line is this line of our evolution,
is the line of sustenance, is the line by

00:48:27.319 --> 00:48:29.690
which we have become human beings.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:37.490
First of all we get our sustenance, like we
can say the gold is untarnishable.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:39.039
That is the sustenance of gold.

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:46.119
We can say carbon has four valences, in the
same way human beings have ten valences – they

00:48:46.119 --> 00:48:48.549
are in the stomach.

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:54.339
These are the ten sustenance described as
the Ten Commandments in the Bible.

00:48:54.339 --> 00:48:58.029
They all can be explained very well in Sahaj
Yoga.

00:48:58.029 --> 00:49:05.829
This is the human sustenance which is around
in that part which we call as Void.

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:12.700
It’s not the same Void, or is the gap, as
the Zen, but this is the Void, we mean the

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:18.930
space where we exist in our evolutionary state.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:26.069
Now this center is the one that is presided
over – this one, the second one is presided

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:31.609
over by the Creator, and this one is through
the Preserver, the one who preserves.

00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:37.390
Now there can be a problem with people who
believe that there is one God.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.849
I also believe the same thing.

00:49:38.849 --> 00:49:42.779
I mean, it is true: He – there’s only
one God, but He has different aspects.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:46.049
God doesn’t exist like, say, Rock of Gibraltar.

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:50.319
Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you see, it has
got aspects.

00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:57.329
God has aspects like a gentleman, now say
for example if a gentleman is a minister here,

00:49:57.329 --> 00:50:02.859
he could be a husband, he could be a father,
he could be a brother, he could be anything.

00:50:02.859 --> 00:50:08.390
So God has different aspects and out of that
the first aspect, as I told you of the existence,

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:16.420
the power of existence, that does not incarnate
on this earth, it does not incarnate, it just

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:21.809
exist, it watches, it sees, and that is in
the heart, which is the Spirit – expression

00:50:21.809 --> 00:50:29.349
of that God Almighty who is watching the spectacle
of His Power.

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:35.200
Now the other aspect of God is that He’s
a Creator, He creates all these galaxies and

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:43.660
all these things now as I told you yesterday
about the Vishuddhi Chakra, we are this center

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:51.999
which is America, that if this center is awakened
here, you don’t have to have any missiles

00:50:51.999 --> 00:50:53.900
or anything.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:00.789
As in the Saturn, you have got a girdle around,
you too have that girdle around America and

00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:03.900
nobody can touch you, but you are to be awakened
first of all.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.569
If you are awakened in that center, nobody
can touch you.

00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:16.609
Russia is going to know about it, they have
to know about it because they are getting

00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:20.549
into parapsychology and all these things and
they are going to get possessed about this.

00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:25.279
They have to know through their supraconscious
that you are the people who are awakened.

00:51:25.279 --> 00:51:30.609
Once you are awakened nobody can touch you,
because there’s a girdle round you, and

00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:36.279
there are sixteen sub-plexuses as there are
sixteen, you have seen there are sixteen substar

00:51:36.279 --> 00:51:38.010
– sub, what do you call them?

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.010
Warren: Moons

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:45.450
Shri Mataji: Moons, they call them moons,
sixteen moons around Saturn.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:48.250
And you are one guided by Saturn.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.650
Saturn makes this country.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:55.460
Saturn has made this country, and this is
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is a very important

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.529
chakra about which I’ll tell later.

00:51:57.529 --> 00:52:01.479
So this center we come to of our evolution.

00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:08.219
Is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of
preservation, He’s the Father who looks

00:52:08.219 --> 00:52:13.369
after us; He’s the One who gives us our
wellbeing.

00:52:13.369 --> 00:52:16.800
He comes on this earth again and again in
different forms.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:26.229
According to Indian Puranas, the Ark of Noah
was saved by a fish, which was a dolphin,

00:52:26.229 --> 00:52:29.400
and this dolphin fish was this aspect which
incarnated.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:38.289
Then the second aspect came as the tortoise,
then the third as a quadiped.

00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:43.819
Like that they have described the evolution,
how these incarnations had to come to break

00:52:43.819 --> 00:52:49.650
the barriers of the evolutionary ignorance.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:53.109
These are the people who came for the break-through.

00:52:53.109 --> 00:53:01.299
Ultimately a short man was created called
as Vamana, then a very fiery, big man, he’s

00:53:01.299 --> 00:53:04.440
called as Passidon, [Poseidon – ED] in Greek
language.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.359
Greeks made their gods look like human beings;
I mean they never kept their purity.

00:53:10.359 --> 00:53:14.210
See, everybody was given with some quality
of a human being.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.940
I don’t know why they did it but that’s
how they spoiled the whole game.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:25.999
Now this god, the god, which we can say or
the incarnation that came on this earth was

00:53:25.999 --> 00:53:35.789
a fiery man, a man who fought the nature,
who fought all the different elements.

00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:45.940
And then after that came another aspect on
this earth, who was Shri Rama, is the ideal

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:54.390
king, the king who is a benevolent king, the
One who gave us the political idea about how

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.960
to govern – Shri Rama – this was eight
thousand years back.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:05.190
Then came the incarnation, after that the
incarnation came in the center here, before,

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:10.299
before Rama, this incarnation was of the Goddess,
of the primordial Mother.

00:54:10.299 --> 00:54:17.660
She Herself incarnated on this earth before
Rama, because many forces which were negative

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:23.660
were collected by the ignorance of human beings,
and the seekers were very much harmed.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:31.950
So She came on this earth to kill those horrible,
demonic forces and to destroy them and to

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:38.650
save the seekers, Her children, to save them
from this drowning into the sea of illusion,

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.420
and She came on this earth.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:46.729
As they say she came thousand times, but actually
She came many-a-times before Shri Rama came

00:54:46.729 --> 00:54:47.729
in.

00:54:47.729 --> 00:54:52.390
Then came Shri Rama who came on the right-hand
side of the heart.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.239
Now this is also a very important center within
us.

00:54:55.239 --> 00:54:58.329
Those people who have problems with the fatherhood.

00:54:58.329 --> 00:55:03.530
Like today there was a girl who was catching
on the right hand, this heart, this is the

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.530
center.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:10.460
We asked her what about her father, and she
told Me, “My father is dead but he’s still

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.729
guiding me.”

00:55:11.729 --> 00:55:15.240
I said, “That’s not good, you must give
relief to your father.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.749
He should be given freedom, and you will feel
better.”

00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:21.950
And people with this heart get asthma.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:27.259
This side, this problem, on this finger we
feel, get asthma, problems with their breathing…

00:55:27.259 --> 00:55:33.950
All these things can be cured if you just
tell them that, “You ask your father to

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:37.480
leave you and to be born again and forget
about it.”

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.619
It works wonders, we have seen.

00:55:39.619 --> 00:55:51.900
But recently a doctor in England has performed
some experiments with, what you call, anorexia

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.430
– there’s a disease anorexia, where the
girls just don’t eat any food.

00:55:55.430 --> 00:56:00.089
He found out that these girls, when they were
told about their father, and that a rite can

00:56:00.089 --> 00:56:06.069
be, I mean the after death rites can be done
and all that, they felt all right and they

00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:07.490
got rid of it.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:11.900
Can you imagine this is experimented and found
out now; I mean this we have been doing for

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:16.339
the last ten years, but recently it has been
found out that if a girl is suffering from

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:22.479
this disease of anorexia, you can cure it;
if the father is dead, then only it happens.

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:30.359
So fatherhood –a man who is not a good father,
a man who has a bad father, a girl who is

00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:38.270
too much attached to the father or a girl
who is not treated nicely also by her husband

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.650
– also the husband is there – if he doesn’t
look after her well, she can suffer.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:47.119
Now the center part, this one – the one
he’s there [Warren is showing on the Virata

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:51.680
Chakra chart] – center heart, it’s also
a very, very important center where the Goddess

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:59.440
– the world, we say the Mother of the World,
Jagadamba She’s called – has incarnated.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:07.089
Is a very important thing for us, because
when you suffer, say, from any insecurities,

00:57:07.089 --> 00:57:15.160
then this center starts going into palpitations,
this center starts vibrating very much.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:21.019
Till the boy is of twelve years or a girl
is of twelve years, in the sternum bone the

00:57:21.019 --> 00:57:24.400
antibodies are created by this center.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:30.140
This center creates the antibodies and they
circulate in the whole body and remain there,

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:36.479
and whenever there is an attack, either from
a entity or from any disease or anything,

00:57:36.479 --> 00:57:38.259
these antibodies fight it.

00:57:38.259 --> 00:57:42.640
And that is the center which is very important,
specially for women.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:48.249
If their motherhood is challenged or if they
are insecure, if their husbands are making

00:57:48.249 --> 00:57:54.490
them insecure by any of their behavior, then
they develop this trouble of this center,

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.690
where they may get breast cancer.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.729
Breast cancer comes to women when they are
insecure.

00:58:00.729 --> 00:58:09.259
Only it can be cured when this center is awakened;
breast cancer can be very easily cured, if

00:58:09.259 --> 00:58:15.670
they could be secured through awakening of
this center of the Mother of the Universe.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:21.640
And then we have the center up there, which
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is a very important…

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:34.269
for you, because it is adorned by the completion
of this evolution as called as Virat – it

00:58:34.269 --> 00:58:41.579
is Shri Krishna, who is the complete incarnation
of this primordial being.

00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:44.440
And He is placed there.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:53.190
It is He who is the witness, who is watching.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:58.400
When the Kundalini rises over this, you start
witnessing the whole thing.

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:04.749
It has got sixteen sub plexuses and which
look after your face, your nose, eyes, ears

00:59:04.749 --> 00:59:06.759
and all these places.

00:59:06.759 --> 00:59:13.130
And when this center is out, then you have
all kinds of problems.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:20.299
Say the left side, left side Vishuddhi Chakra
catches when you feel guilty, when you are

00:59:20.299 --> 00:59:21.299
diffident.

00:59:21.299 --> 00:59:24.900
When you start thinking that, “It is very
wrong too, I should have not done this,”

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.190
and all that, then the left Vishuddhi catches.

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:32.440
Or also with smoking it catches; smoking spoils
this center very much.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:37.450
Imagine in America the percentage of smokers
is the maximum.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:43.369
Can you imagine, in this center only where
they are born, this is the maximum here?

00:59:43.369 --> 00:59:47.500
Like England is the heart of the universe,
where they are lethargic.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:53.880
Europe is the liver of the world where they
are drinking.

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:58.829
America is the Vishuddhi of the world where
they are smoking.

00:59:58.829 --> 01:00:01.640
What a justice done to themselves and to God,
their Creator!

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.279
So smoking is against this center.

01:00:03.279 --> 01:00:09.759
Thank God now it is established that it causes
cancer, but still people are smoking, they

01:00:09.759 --> 01:00:12.500
say, “What does it matter?”

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.059
But this is a very, very important center
for us because this is the time when we raised

01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:18.680
our head, this center came up.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:23.660
Now see the ego and superego start developing
actually from here.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.109
So this gives rise to ego and superego.

01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:32.420
Somebody is a very arrogant person, catches
on the right; who is a very aggressive type

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.420
he catches on the right Vishuddhi.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:47.089
In the center, a person who is against God,
who is anti-God, who is against collectivity,

01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:53.920
who is talking against God, who is openly
saying things against God, catches on this

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.950
center.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:01:02.529
So this center, as it is, is very important
for you, because if you can awaken this center

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:07.349
within you here, as I’ve told you, you become
as powerful as Shri Krishna.

01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:10.079
Shri Krishna has a Samhara Shakti.

01:01:10.079 --> 01:01:17.890
He has the power to kill; He has four special
things with Him, four weapons by which He

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:24.539
kills, but one of them is this, in His hand,
is a discus and this discus is shown around

01:01:24.539 --> 01:01:27.549
the Saturn which you see.

01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:32.459
And with this discus at any distance He can
destroy.

01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:36.029
So His destructive powers are built in you.

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.969
Nobody can destroy you.

01:01:39.969 --> 01:01:44.069
You have to just get to your Self and become
your Self.

01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:50.759
You’ll become so powerful a nation – but
powerful in loving, in being compassionate

01:01:50.759 --> 01:01:57.940
and affectionate, in the real sense of the
word, not the way we are now trying to help

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.619
others; is not the way.

01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:04.660
It can be very disgraceful sometimes; the
way we try to help others can be very disgraceful.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:10.280
You will be amazed how, sometimes you people
have helped and have created problem for others.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.690
I’ll give a very simple example which is
really surprising and astonishing.

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:23.150
Some years back we had a dearth of wheat,
and people sent horrible wheat to India, horrible,

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.650
that even the animals would not eat.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:27.289
Just to help us, you see.

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:30.450
We are not so badly off people; we are very
fussy about food.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:35.109
We may be poor but we don’t eat everything;
we are very fussy.

01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:38.759
So people threw away that wheat outside.

01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:44.680
That wheat grew into a grass, which was called
as “Congress Grass,” can you imagine,

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:52.660
and that grass started moving from the roads
to the fields, from the fields to all the

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.700
trees and started engulfing them.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:03.619
It was like a mad grass, it was like a malignant
grass, eating away everything that there was.

01:03:03.619 --> 01:03:08.151
Imagine, as it is we had dearth of thing and
this thing came, and we didn’t know what

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:10.470
to do with it.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:15.849
So we tried some Sahaj Yoga tricks and it
has worked, and thank God that grass is now

01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:16.849
finished.

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:23.349
But from that grass you had sent some other
seeds of acacia, and these also people threw

01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:24.349
away.

01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:29.839
Out of this came out such horrible trees of
acacia that it has got thorns which are poisonous.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.819
And in the villages they have grown so big
that children can’t play and if they touch

01:03:33.819 --> 01:03:36.059
that they get very seriously ill.

01:03:36.059 --> 01:03:39.849
It’s a very seri– which you have done
so innocently.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:46.949
There’s no grace about it, I think, the
way it was done, and that’s how we can create

01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:49.630
problem through our help to others because
what is there to help.

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.780
Who is the other?

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.130
If you are the collectivity, if you are Shri
Krishna, then what are you helping?

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.579
You are helping yourself, this is your own
finger.

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:05.410
If you help your own finger, you don’t help
it in a different way than you help other

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:08.920
fingers.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.079
That means you become collective being, and
you are.

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:18.039
People like Abraham Lincoln, as I said yesterday,
and great people in this country established

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:19.380
these great ideals of liberty.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:32.170
And the liberty, they said that, even Roosevelt
once said that “Poverty anywhere is a threat

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.400
to prosperity anywhere.”

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.819
What at great thing to say, to feel that,
that oneness with others, that anywhere poverty

01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:43.319
is a threat to our prosperity!

01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:48.670
All this collectivity has been expressed by
your great men in this country, not only but

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:57.150
the sense of responsibility because it is
on your shoulders, the responsibility.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:05.239
Responsibility of making others the Self,
realize, is your responsibility.

01:05:05.239 --> 01:05:09.769
You are the responsible nation, you are responsible
for the whole universe, whatever things you

01:05:09.769 --> 01:05:12.579
do here that goes outside.

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:17.119
You took to rock ’n roll, people started
doing rock ’n roll, you did anything nonsensical

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:18.719
that started going abroad.

01:05:18.719 --> 01:05:20.250
Anything nonsensical you do here spreads everywhere
because Americans are doing.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.780
Jeans, now everybody wears, even in India!

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:31.099
Imagine in that hot country they are wearing
very strong, starched ones, and they get all

01:05:31.099 --> 01:05:36.339
kinds of problems with that, circulation problems
[INDISTINCT: I mean?], but…

01:05:36.339 --> 01:05:39.789
“Americans are doing,” everybody is becoming
American in India.

01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:44.670
That’s it, in every developing country you
have put your hand; you have interest in everyone,

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:52.549
but should be done after realization when
you feel the pangs of others, you feel the

01:05:52.549 --> 01:06:00.469
heart, you feel the real pain of others within
yourself, and you do it, not because you want

01:06:00.469 --> 01:06:03.369
to do it for others, but do it because you
want to save yourself out of that pain.

01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:04.420
You do it for yourself.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:10.650
If somebody’s drowned and you try to save
a person who is drowned, then you don’t

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:14.549
save him you actually are saving yourself
because something in you is getting drowned

01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:16.369
there.

01:06:16.369 --> 01:06:20.589
And that happens to you when you become that
collective being, when you become the Spirit,

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:22.569
then it happens to you.

01:06:22.569 --> 01:06:27.850
Before that, whatever you do is disgraceful,
sometimes can be harmful, can be very ugly

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.829
and sometimes it can be so grotesque that
people say, “All right, you keep your help

01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:34.329
to yourself, we don’t want to have any more
of this.”

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:41.099
I mean you take away all the self-respect
of people.

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:49.809
So one has to understand that you stand here
in this world, in this universe as a collective

01:06:49.809 --> 01:06:54.400
being, as the representative of that collective
being at this Vishuddhi Chakra and you have

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.380
to give with your hands.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.980
For giving.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:04.710
This applies to your hands and you must give,
those hands which have never given are no

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:10.390
good, they are very insensitive hands, you
must give, and that must come into you, and

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:17.910
not giving for giving’s sake, but Nirvach,,
as they say, without any, any return about

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:18.910
it.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.779
Nothing, is just giving, just flowing, just
like the Sun’s rays are coming to you, they

01:07:22.779 --> 01:07:25.739
don’t want anything in return, do they?

01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:26.739
Just flowing.

01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:36.190
When that should happen, if Sahaj Yoga takes
to it, I hope it takes to America that Americans

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:39.119
accept Sahaj Yog, that it works out.

01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:41.700
You have already got all kinds of horrible
people here.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:48.140
I don’t know how you are going to work it
out, but God willing, with your determination,

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.219
I am sure.

01:07:50.219 --> 01:07:56.640
This is the first Unity Church I’m visiting
and I hope that in other Unity Churches also,

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.839
it will be made convenient for Me and we can
save other people also, and they can become

01:08:02.839 --> 01:08:14.759
realized souls and they can become the Vishuddhi
Chakras, the responsible people, men of God,

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:19.259
those who have to become prophets, that they
are responsible that they have to make others

01:08:19.259 --> 01:08:28.880
also prophets and save so many seekers who
are gathered in this great country of yours

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:35.410
because they know here it will happen, and
that they should be enabled to enter into

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:38.850
the Kingdom of God because the time has come
for that.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:45.819
So we come up to Vishuddhi Chakra, and the
last center, chakra, here is the center of

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:46.819
Christ.

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:50.140
[ASIDE: Should I go?

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:57.060
If I do it tomorrow, would be better.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.799
All right?]

01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:03.430
Tomorrow about Christ I’ll tell you because
I want to take one hour explaining Him very

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.430
well.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:13.380
I was very much impressed by your whole idea
about Christ, the unity, the integration and

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:18.670
your symbols are very correct, everything
is just there, somebody has to just trigger

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:23.549
it, and it will work out.

01:09:23.549 --> 01:09:30.940
First you must get your realization, grow
into it, develop your discrimination, you

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:35.460
become your own guru, and then everything
that you are doing in this Unity Church will

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:42.690
have a great meaning, you can prove it, you
can prove it that there is God, there is Christ,

01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:44.420
there are all these incarnations.

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.940
Christ Himself has said that “Those who
are not against Me are with Me.”

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.250
These are the people.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:59.200
And I’m sure one day it will happen that
Unity Church will show its own worth, its

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.990
own explanation of its existence, why it came
into existence.

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:12.230
Thank you very much.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:17.460
May God bless you.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:28.920
If you have any questions you may ask, and
then we’ll have the session for realization.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:46.020
Seeker: Sometimes in meditation and in chanting,
a person will be rocking.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:52.470
Would you consider that a negative thing?

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:57.090
Warren: Sometimes in meditation people will
rock or move.

01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:58.440
Is this a negative thing?

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.590
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:06.080
You should not rock, there should be no movement,
the eyes should be steady, there should be

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.310
no movement in the eyelids, nothing.

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:10.550
This rocking is absolutely wrong.

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:16.310
All these things should not happen to you,
that’s not meditation.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:23.210
Meditation is where you are absolutely normal,
you are always in meditation after realization,

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.350
you are in meditation.

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:31.980
Question: I’ve studied with Paramahansa
Yogananda the SRF, Self-Realization Fellowship,

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:40.740
and one of the things they teach is to focus
the eyes, with the eyes closed only on the

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.740
[INAUDIBLE].

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:45.570
Shri Mataji: I must say that I don’t want
to start any controversy.

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:53.670
That’s one thing sure, but I’ll tell you
that proof of the pudding is in the eating.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.600
Let’s go this way.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.140
First of all logically we should see, we have
to get baptism through here, not through here.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.850
Do we get baptism through here?

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:10.660
If the door is here what’s the use of breaking
this window?

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:17.520
And focusing and effort is not going to give
you realization, is wrong.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.550
You see this pampers– human effort, you
see it pampers you that you can put in an

01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:23.550
effort.

01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.550
You cannot.

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:28.170
One must accept this position: we cannot put
in an effort for a living thing.

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:33.830
For example, as I told you, for a seed if
you have to sprout it you have to put it in

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:34.830
the Mother Earth.

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.620
You cannot pull it out, isn’t it?

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.520
Whatever you may try, you cannot pull it out
and sprout.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.100
You cannot put in any effort.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:50.450
Any effort is wrong, is against spontaneity
and living things.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.870
So no effort is needed as such.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:13:01.120
Lady: I’d like to ask Her about that center
where the immune bodies develop, at what age

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:14.800
and what can we do in order to make that immunity
get bigger or…

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.700
Warren: She says two questions.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:25.230
At what age does the immune bodies start developing
and secondly is there any way in which you

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:27.780
can expand the capacity of the immune bodies?

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.870
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:32.340
Of course, that is what Sahaj Yoga is.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:37.400
When you become the truth, all untruth falls
off, is that is what Sahaj Yoga is; absolutely

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.410
that is what it is.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:42.780
Tomorrow, I am going to tell you about Christ
and about cancer; about all these immune bodies

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.880
how we fight them.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.970
That may be day after tomorrow, I don’t
know, but tomorrow, may not be, but day after

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.940
tomorrow I’ll tell you how to grow into
it.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Absolutely.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:55.100
You learn how to protect, you learn how to
fight.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.270
Absolutely.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:14:03.960
That is what happens after realization then
you must learn the divine technique, not before

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960
realization.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.480
After realization, not before.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.500
Before it is connected what’s the use of
playing with it?

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.040
It has to be connected first.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.160
What is it?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.320
Warren: Any other questions?

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:31.850
Man: What are the avenues available to keep
these channels open?

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.890
Warren: What are the avenues available to
keep the channels open?

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:37.980
Shri Mataji: To be your Spirit.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:46.180
And we will let you know later on how to work
it out, how to balance yourself, how the imbalances

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.180
are there.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.400
This I’ll do it on Wednesday.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.760
I will tell you how to keep them clear, how
to keep your chakras clear, how to work it

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.050
out, everything I’ll tell you.

01:14:58.050 --> 01:14:59.050
And also –

01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:03.640
[We don’t have a book about it, isn’t
it, but in any case –

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640
Warren: We’ve got the “Advent.”

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640
Shri Mataji: Oh yes.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640
]

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.400
We have a very big book on this Sahaj Yoga,
which of course we do not sell to everyone,

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.570
but we’ll see about it.

01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:18.830
We’ll see about it because you people are
growing very fast.

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:23.290
If you people really grow, then we’ll sell
it to you also, but normally we don’t sell

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.290
it to everyone.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:28.020
Question: Do you feel Hatha Yoga is necessary?

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.910
Shri Mataji: Not at all, nothing.

01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:35.500
On the contrary Hatha Yoga creates a problem,
I told you in the morning, to a lady who was

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.540
doing Hatha Yoga.

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:42.910
I told her how Hatha Yoga in the modern times
means nothing but physical acrobats.

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:44.400
It is not that.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.150
Hatha Yoga was practiced about, I don’t
know how many years back, about eight thousand

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:56.150
years back, when we had a different system
of life, where children from five to twenty-five

01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:01.850
lived with a guru who was a realized soul,
and led a very celibate life.

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:09.400
To such an extent that, that university, any
university – say somebody’s university

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:15.510
was Vishwamitra, then that realized soul was
Vishwamitra and that university people could

01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:17.670
not marry, even today they cannot marry.

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:19.420
Even today they cannot marry each other.

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.490
The celibacy of that kind was present in those
days.

01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:27.540
And in that time when you were completely
celibate, you were innocent, you were given

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.410
these Ashtang Yogas.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:37.730
There are eightfold paths [DEL: of Sahaj]
of this Hatha Yoga, out of which eighth one

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:44.110
is Yama-niyama where the discipline and things
are there to maintain a proper life that was

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:45.730
given to them.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:52.370
And then after that when that was done, the
maintenance of the proper life and all that

01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:58.600
was taught, also they were told the exercises
when according to the movement of the Kundalini

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.120
wherever was the problem.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:07.410
Supposing the problem is in your particular
center, then you have to do that movement,

01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:10.600
that particular exercise you have to do.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.170
But it’s, as I told you this morning, that
your car has not started, you are still at

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:17.790
home and you are paying the toll for what?

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:22.620
You must move, to find out where is the obstruction,
then you pay the toll.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.900
And nowadays it is so absurd that we take
[DEL: the Saha–] the Hatha Yoga in such

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:34.150
a manner that we take the whole medicine box
without having any disease and get diseased.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.170
It’s a big science.

01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:41.580
Is a very big science one has to understand
that everything is correlated: How is your

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:46.980
center, which center is catching, what center
requires what kind of treatment, how to clear

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.490
it, and this technique you will learn in no
time.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:49.490
It’s very simple, once you get your realization.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:55.590
Question: Is there anything that we can start
doing now?

01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:00.590
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now I’m going to
give you realization.

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:01.590
All right?

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:04.830
That’s it, that’s just like a seeker,
just like a seeker.

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:05.830
[Warren: On the sheet it tells them how to
meditate as well.

01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:06.830
Shri Mataji: Oh that I will tell later.]

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:07.830
Ha.

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:08.830
Now what about you?

01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:09.830
You have been raising your hand.

01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:14.160
Question: What kind of a… what kind of a
yoga did Lord Krishna practice?

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.530
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yoga.

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:20.060
[Shri Mataji chuckles.]

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:26.380
Question: According to Yogananda, he said
that Lord Krishna practiced Kriya Yoga.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.730
Shri Mataji: Not at all, Is wrong.

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:29.524
He, it is just to apportion of himself to
[INDISTINCT: you.]

01:18:29.524 --> 01:18:36.820
You see, Shri Krishna, if I have time I can
tell them, He in His Gita, He has prescribed

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:37.850
four things.

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:45.040
But Krishna was an incarnation of diplomacy;
He was an incarnation of divine diplomacy

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:53.920
we should say, because when he told Arjuna
that you find it within yourself, the first

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.790
thing, – He was not a businessman, so He
told the best thing first.

01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:01.970
He said, “Find it within yourself the gyana,
the awareness.”

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:06.590
In your awareness you should find it, you
should find your Spirit, should become that.

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:09.500
This is the first thing He told.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:16.700
But he was, that time a mediocre, an intellectual
I should say, and he said that “You are

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:22.490
telling me to fight the war and here You are
saying that you find yourself and you become

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:25.810
yourself, and to be a witness!”

01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:30.080
What Shri Krishna meant was that you become
a witness, then the whole thing becomes a

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.600
drama, but he didn’t understand.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:40.490
He, being a father, I give an analogy of a
father who is telling his son that, “The

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:45.200
horse is behind the cart, so put the horse
in front so the cart will move.”

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.930
But the son is saying that “Why not sitting
down here I move the cart?”

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.420
So he says, “All right, go ahead.”

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:56.960
He says, “All right, go ahead,” because
if you tell them straightforward they don’t

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.960
listen to you so tell them in another way.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:06.500
So the diplomacy, as the essence that you
give absurd conditions, such absurd conditions

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.890
that people discover later on and find that
it was absurd.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:22.830
So the absurd condition He said that the first
thing you do is to do your karmas, do what

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:26.820
you want to do and put it at the lotus feet
of the Lord – is an absurd condition.

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:33.890
You cannot do it because your ego is intact,
you may believe, “I am serving the Lord.”

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:37.950
You may believe it, “believe” is different
from reality, you are not.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:43.150
Because ego is there, and that’s why you
feel hurt, sometimes you take the credit.

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:49.000
Unless and until you are realized, unless
and until you become a holy personality you’ll

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.240
never say like that.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.500
After realization what do you say, “It’s
going, it’s coming, Mother it’s not working,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.500
it just doesn’t work.”

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.980
“It,” you start talking in a third person.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:05.240
You don’t say, “I’m giving you realization,”
you don’t say so.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.590
“It’s not working.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.590
It has worked.

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:09.590
It has come up.”

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:10.590
“What?”

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:11.590
”Realization.”

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:12.590
You don’t say “I.”

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:16.740
So you become an akarmi, means like the sun
shines, it doesn’t say, “I shine.”

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.740
There is no karma attached, this was the first
thing He said.

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:25.550
But this absurdity people never saw, and they
– even today people say, “I am serving

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:26.550
the Lord.”

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:32.030
But you are not even connected, how are you
serving Him?

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.210
That’s one thing.

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:39.640
Because there is ego, you are identified with
ego; actually you are serving your ego.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.320
Unless and until you become realized, you
do not serve God.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.470
This is one point which was absurd, He told.

01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:48.840
Then second point – this is Karma Yoga.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:54.750
The second point He said was, that “You
should do Bhakti Yoga.”

01:21:54.750 --> 01:22:00.280
Bhakti Yoga is that you should worship Him,
worship God, pray to Him.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:06.100
But as usual because He was diplomacy He put
a very interesting word called Ananya.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.630
You should do Ananya Bhakti.

01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:10.830
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:20.300
When there is not the other, when you are
not the other, when you are one with God.

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.240
That means all those people who are talking,
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.840
Krishna” on Oxford Street are not connected.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.660
They are spoiling their throat, will get throat
cancers.

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.070
You are not yet connected, you should be ananya.

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:38.860
Ananya means you should be realized; you should
be connected with God.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:45.810
Imagine, supposing your President Reagan,
I go to him and stand before his house and

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:48.540
start calling, “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan,”
I’ll be arrested.

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.750
I must have a proper protocol, I must have
proper permission, I should have a proper

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.690
way of going there, isn’t it?

01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:59.500
Everybody starts calling God as if He’s
in his pocket.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:08.210
“God give me a job, give me money, give
me a car, give me this,” I mean, imagine.

01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.840
You have to be connected with God.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.110
That’s what He said very clearly, “ananya,”
but these people, these are blind people they

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:16.190
cannot see through.

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:25.110
Then the third thing He said that, “It happens
within you that you get these happenings,”

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:29.030
is the Kundalini Yoga.

01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:34.370
He said that when the Kundalini starts, the
jalandhara bhanda and all these bhandas take

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:36.560
place when the Kundalini rises.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:42.680
These granthis go into a particular kind of
a formation like a car when you start all

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.680
the engines starts moving.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.210
So He described all the engine, how it moves.

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:51.140
That, this Mr. Yogananda picked up and he
said He preached Kriya Yoga.

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:55.490
That means if you, say, have a car which has
stopped which has not yet started, you move

01:23:55.490 --> 01:24:00.710
the wheel and you move all the machines, will
it work?

01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:05.460
You cannot do it.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.650
It happens automatically.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:09.380
It is spontaneous happening within us.

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:14.120
When we eat our food how the food is digested?

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.000
Automatically.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.790
In the same way when Kundalini rises, to support
its rise all these bhandas and all these kriyas

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:28.760
take place and kechari, also your tongue is
pulled in, so people they cut their tongues,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.400
put it back.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.580
Is that the way?

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:35.650
Is absolutely artificial, is stupid.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:40.430
To do like that, many people I have seen.

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:44.060
I don’t know the early ones who came, of
Yogananda they had the tongues wagging like

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.060
that?

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:49.370
Imagine by doing all these things, “take
out your eyes, take out your nose.”

01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:53.070
This is not the way.

01:24:53.070 --> 01:25:01.100
And that, “You suffer, you shave your heads,
wear a kind of a cloth,” you cannot.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:06.900
It’s a thing that’s living within you
and acts in a living way.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.060
You cannot just maneuver it artificially,
you cannot.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.650
It has to start!.

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:16.960
Like even this camera, you see, a television,
anything, this has to be put to the mains.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.710
You cannot start with your finger the camera
working, can you?

01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:27.380
The electricity has to be there, in the same
way energy of Kundalini has to be there to

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.970
work it out.

01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:34.560
This is absurd.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:41.250
So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri
Krishna, is the living process.

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.250
He said, “Is the living tree.”

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:45.260
I’m surprised.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:53.270
We can… human beings are very great, I must
say, the way they make a pai out of everyone.

01:25:53.270 --> 01:26:00.130
So all these great incarnations came on this
earth; they wrote it very clearly; they said

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:08.670
everything very clearly; it was very simple;
there was nothing to be so much deluded – of

01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:10.450
course he used a word like ananya.

01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:14.660
You see in any dictionary what is the meaning
of word ananya is, mean is “when is there

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:22.540
is not the other.”

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.590
What have we made of Christ, what have we
made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama?

01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:29.100
When I see this I’m amazed.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:36.120
But you can’t make anything out of Me, because
you will get your realization.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:42.570
After that, if you try to do anything to Me,
you lose your vibrations, straightforward.

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:44.500
I can tell you this much.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:49.110
There was a gentleman who got his realization
from Me, an Indian.

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:55.150
Typically he went to New York, started his
thing and then in Los Angeles he started a

01:26:55.150 --> 01:27:02.320
Sahaj Yoga center, and he came back to see
Me in Bombay, and the Sahaj Yogis told that

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.670
“He is just giving us a fit.

01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:06.390
Is horrible.

01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:09.830
His vibrations are horrible.”

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.000
I said, “I know that, you don’t talk to
him.”

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.730
So I called him, I said, “What do you do?”

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:21.740
“Oh, I have started a big thing there in
Los Angeles and in New York and this and that.”

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.500
“All right, can I have a brochure?”

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:31.440
You won’t believe he had written, that for
ordinary vibrations seventy-five dollars and

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.320
for extraordinary, special vibrations hundred
and seventy-five dollars.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.830
So I said, “Oh God, what’s this?”

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:41.510
I said, “How do you do this way?”

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:43.860
He says, “Yes Mother, that’s [DEL: what]
how we are to do.

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.080
After all, I have to live.”

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.930
I said, “You have to live, all right, you
do your work that you were doing.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:53.330
You were teaching something, you do that,
but you cannot sell these vibrations; I didn’t

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:54.630
give you for selling.

01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:56.470
Did you buy from Me?”

01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:59.970
And he wouldn’t believe.

01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:04.490
And he was very angry and then he went away.

01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:08.820
He said, “There’s a guru who is in Calicut,
He’s a very wonderful man.”

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.500
I said, “You go and see him.”

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:14.050
He went and saw him, and this guru wouldn’t
allow him to enter into his house.

01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:15.100
He threw stones at him.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.990
He wouldn’t allow him to enter even the
gate.

01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:24.380
So he went back to the station, so he was
sitting down there, then somebody met him

01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:29.480
from the guru, he said that “Guru was saying
that, ‘he went and insulted Mother and how

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.230
does he come to be here?

01:28:31.230 --> 01:28:33.860
I’ll not see his face.’”

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:40.410
Then he sat there for three days, and he was
allowed to go, and then guru sent a very good

01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:44.570
poem about Me in Sanskrit language, which
he read it out to Me.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.780
But the fellow is just the same still.

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:52.670
He’s not changed; he’s just the same.

01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:56.900
Now he has no vibrations, he’s not a Sahaj
yogi, he has nothing to do, but he has an

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.880
ashram, he’s making money out of it.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.630
Of course we have withdrawn our photographs
and everything but he’s just the same, what

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:03.190
am I to do?

01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:08.340
He is now making them stand on their heads
and do all kinds of things.

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.440
And he has more people than you are here.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.640
That’s the best part of it.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.570
People are more attracted to these things
than to reality.

01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:20.770
Is very true.

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:25.980
When I came last time to America there was
a lady.

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.420
I told her that, “Your guru was believing
in all miracles, and you better not start

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.420
it.”

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.580
She said, “No, no, no, no.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.640
I want the ultimate, I want the parama, I’m
not going to go into it.”

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.120
I said, “All right.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120
Promise Me.”

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120
She said, “Yes.”

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.140
But then she started getting some sort of
a rice falling from her hand and all that

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.550
and then she started doing her things, you
see?

01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:50.240
She called people told them even the name
of the horses which are going to win, all

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.450
sorts of things.

01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:59.020
And you won’t believe, when I went back
to America to My most embarrassed condition,

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:05.860
I found that she had three thousand disciples
falling at her feet.

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.910
And she was absolutely possessed.

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:11.680
She came to Me and I told her, “What are
you doing?”

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.770
She said, “Mother, this is the powers You
have given me.”

01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:17.780
I said, “I have never given you these powers
to beat people and tell them about horses.

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.060
Is absurd.”

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:23.360
She said, “But this is happening to me.”

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.800
I said, “All supraconscious, all nonsense.”

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.750
She wouldn’t listen.

01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:32.450
I said, “All right, tell this gentleman
about his future.”

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:33.970
She told him something.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:37.390
He said , “It’s all wrong, it’s not
true.”

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:39.530
I said, “Tell this lady.”

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:40.810
She couldn’t tell.

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:45.090
So she said, “Mother, have you taken away
my powers?”

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.420
I said, “If they were your powers, I would
have garlanded, I would have worshiped you,

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.610
but they are not yours, they have gone, finished.”

01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:53.320
But she would not give up, you see popularity,
she was on with it.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:58.400
Now only thing is she’s in a lunatic asylum.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:10.180
So all these things they do, they know how
to make these things, they are so superficial.

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.670
They don’t know what injuries they are doing
to themselves and to others.

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:19.990
Now, who were asking some question?

01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.990
Man.

01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:30.000
I wanted to ask You about the meditations
from the Maharishi Mahayoga, what Your opinion

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
was.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.930
Shri Mataji: Now again the controversy, again
the controversy, the less said the better.

01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:39.000
All right?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.091
Man: The what?

01:31:40.091 --> 01:31:43.470
Shri Mataji: The less said the better.

01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:48.200
For example, the mantras he gives you.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:52.960
You know what they mean, one of them, inga
? It means “the tail of the scorpion.”

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:57.300
Now where is the scorpion and where is the
tail?

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:03.590
When the Kundalini has started, then you should
know which center it is catching and what

01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:04.720
mantra to be said.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.680
It is not that you can just give a mantra
and charge three hundred pounds, and people

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:12.480
do pay.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.450
And this flying squad that he has started,
the head of that flying squad here he is,

01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:18.340
is sitting down here, he will tell you.

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:23.400
The head of that where he went and learnt
from him flying, so called, he suffered from

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.640
epilepsy, his wife suffered from epilepsy,
his daughter suffered from epilepsy, and they

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:34.450
came to Me and they wrote to him about Me,
in that miserable condition.

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:38.690
He was the head; he was going to teach them
flying.

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:43.280
I told him, “Why don’t you ask your guru
to go on this leaning tower of Pisa and make

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.450
him fly?

01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:50.240
And you pay him some money for that, will
be good idea.”

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.810
They paid three thousand pounds for flying.

01:32:52.810 --> 01:33:00.790
You are not going to become birds now, are
you?

01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:05.630
But it is very difficult, you know, to accept
really because you have paid so much money.

01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:09.831
This is like, “We have paid it, so better
have it.”

01:33:09.831 --> 01:33:10.831
You see whatever…

01:33:10.831 --> 01:33:16.350
Like you go to a restaurant and you pay for
it, and may be bad but you eat it.

01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:20.550
You see, after all, you have paid for it.

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:22.370
That’s human nature, isn’t it?

01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:23.470
Oh, it’s terrible.

01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:28.030
It’s terrible, and difficult to give realization
to people from all these gurus, I can tell

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:30.390
you, Yogananda… or this, what’s his name
is?

01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:32.450
This Bhandasura’s name, what is his name?

01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:33.450
Warren: Muktananda.

01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:34.450
Shri Mataji: Muktananda.

01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:38.170
I know them very well, I know them.

01:33:38.170 --> 01:33:44.880
I’ve known them for ages, and they know
Me too.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.600
Yes?

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:58.920
Lady: Are there other sources where you can
reach your realization other than through

01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.920
You?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.920
[Warren repeats the question.]

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:01.920
Shri Mataji: Through Me?

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.800
It’s not a question of through Me or anything;
it’s through your Kundalini, is your Kundalini

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800
within you.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.880
Lady: Is there someone else that can guide
you or…?

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.030
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, I haven’t seen
many.

01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:15.850
I wish somebody could, like – you see people
are very much hurt to see that I’m doing

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:16.850
it.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.990
I said, “Baba, you do it.

01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:21.090
I’ll be very happy to retire, really.”

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:22.620
They said, “Why You, Mother?”

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.800
I said, “Really, I don’t know why I was
chosen for this.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.650
It’s a thankless job.

01:34:27.650 --> 01:34:32.340
You must have tremendous patience, I tell
you.

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:37.210
The day I retire my husband will pay you for
that.

01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:39.630
I can assure you.”

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:47.790
He’s telling Me that “You are trying to
put patches to the heavens which are falling.”

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:50.860
He doesn’t believe that I can do it.

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:55.420
Is a thankless job, absolutely a thankless
job.

01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.950
But what to do?

01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:06.020
Once I did feel little frustrated, and I said,
“Let it be now.

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.030
Doesn’t matter, let the destruction come
in.”

01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:17.360
And then you know this clever man, he brought
a photograph of Mine, with My eyes so compassionate,

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.820
such compassion flowing, I said, “Better
do it.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:21.220
It’s You, what can You do?

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.090
You can’t get out of it, that’s what You
are.”

01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:28.800
So I have to do it, My children, I have to
do it.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.540
If you could do it, I’ll be very happy.

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:36.570
Any one, I’ll be extremely happy and retire.

01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:42.290
Warren softly: Other Sahaja Yogis can.

01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:45.690
Shri Mataji: Ha, Of course!

01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:48.360
Other Sahaj yogis can give you realization.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:53.690
For example Warren himself has given realization
to I don’t know how many thousand.

01:35:53.690 --> 01:36:00.060
But I know of a person who has given realization
to more than ten thousand people, in India.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.060
Yes!

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:05.710
Yes, yes, you can give realization, you can
give it, all right?

01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:12.330
Man: Is the lotus position any special advantage
over sitting normally?

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:15.550
Warren: Is the lotus position any special
advantage?

01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:18.900
Shri Mataji: Not in Sahaj Yoga, not in Sahaj
Yoga.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:26.800
You see now God has decided to give you in
any position you sit; He has to save His creation.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.670
Many people can’t even sit on the ground,
so they are not to be forced now.

01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:33.770
Whatever position you have, you are all right.

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:36.040
You drink, all right.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.110
You take drugs, all right.

01:36:37.110 --> 01:36:39.650
You are a thief, all right.

01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:41.980
Any kind, come along.

01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:44.640
Once you get realization these things will
drop out.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.380
This is the trick.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:52.570
Better come along and have it.

01:36:52.570 --> 01:37:46.420
There’s no position required, nothing required,
only the desire to 

01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:56.560
be the Spirit, that’s all.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:15.570
First one man: We’ll take it.

01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:32.640
[several people start to echo the request:
“We’ll take it.”]

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.460
Warren: They want it.

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:39.540
Shri Mataji: Now they want it, that’s all.

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:43.020
Man: May we have it.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:39:16.510
Shri Mataji: So, that’s all, that’s the
best way.

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:41.670
All right?

01:39:41.670 --> 01:40:40.240
Now those who got 

01:40:40.240 --> 01:43:22.860
it yesterday are here, some of them, and those
who have come for 

01:43:22.860 --> 01:44:36.190
the first time are also here.

01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:59.590
Two ladies: what’s wrong with that?

01:44:59.590 --> 01:45:07.550
What was that again?

01:45:07.550 --> 01:46:26.360
Warren: They just want 
You 

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:37.270
to repeat that, “those that have..”

01:46:37.270 --> 01:49:56.420
Shri Mataji: No, yesterday some people got
realization and 

01:49:56.420 --> 01:51:06.380
some of 

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.920
you are new people.

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:33.910
We’ll have to, later on, see them, those
who are new.

01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:56.470
And those who got realization, specially yesterday,
I 

01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:57.770
would like to meet them.

01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:01.050
As yesterday I couldn’t meet them.

01:52:01.050 --> 01:53:33.810
So I would like to meet them and those who
are new, also we’ll if we can work it out…

01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:53.940

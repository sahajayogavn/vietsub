00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:49.580
I bow to 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:31.600
all the seekers of truth.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:03:43.260
I’ve been many a times in Birmingham before
and today I find there are so many people

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:56.810
whom I know very well, and gradually we are
all increasing in size, understanding our

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.810
Spirit.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.739
Now, the seeking of the Spirit is not a new
thing.

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.420
It’s a very ancient pursuit of human beings.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:23.560
They have been seeking the Spirit and many
a times many prophets, many great incarnations

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.600
came on this Earth to help the people in their
pursuit.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:46.910
The seeking of the Spirit is a inner urge,
a very compelling urge within ourselves.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:05:00.210
But we don’t know what we have to seek;
we don’t know what it means to be twice

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.300
born.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:12.060
I come from India and suddenly I feel I belong
to Britain.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:27.040
I’ve become British and I feel the shock
that we are all facing.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.490
Where are we going?

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:45.699
The other day I saw some program about cocaine
smuggling in England and I was shocked.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:54.450
All self-destructive things sometimes can
be misunderstood as Spirit seeking.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.590
One can misunderstand.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.640
But they lead us nowhere - is a fact.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.150
Then why do we do it?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:23.830
We do it - I know that we do it only because
we are seeking the Spirit.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.889
It’s very misleading, though.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.350
We seek the Spirit in wrong things.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:41.070
This urge we think will be fulfilled by wrong
things, by doing wrong to ourselves, by harming

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.010
ourselves, by torturing ourselves.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.220
We get bored.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.220
Why?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.340
Why do we get bored of life?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.660
Life should be bubbling with joy.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.410
Because we think life is worth nothing, we
have to seek.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.110
And what do we seek there?

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:13.390
It’s a amazing thing how many seekers are
born in the West – so many seekers!

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:23.580
Even I talk to little children and I am surprised
that there is seeking within them.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:33.780
They are seeking something and they don’t
understand the mystery of seeking.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:40.950
They don’t even understand what they are
seeking, but they think there’s something

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.950
wrong.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.380
They feel frustrated, angered, and they feel
that life has not given them what they wanted.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:53.289
They’re bored stiff; they don’t know what
to do so they take to vandalism, some sort

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:54.699
of a sensation.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:02.850
They try to destroy others or themselves.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:12.470
So the human mind today is at a different
level, we must understand, especially in the

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.470
West.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.320
Of course East has its own problems, but it
has traditional understanding about seeking

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.790
and it understands what to seek.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:28.700
But in the West such intense seekers are there
and they don’t know what to seek, what to

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.940
achieve, what is Spirit.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.349
It’s a big problem.

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:43.259
But today one has to realize that the category
of people that are born in these modern times

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:51.149
are very different from the people who were
born about say, I would say fifty years back.

00:08:51.149 --> 00:09:01.759
They had political ambitions, economic ambitions;
they wanted to achieve political freedom,

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:04.189
power.

00:09:04.189 --> 00:09:08.410
That generation is practically over now.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:15.300
They have realized that in this power game
they’re not going to gain anything.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.300
It’s a subject finished now for them; it’s
something absurd.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.769
They find the whole thing is a joke - same
with the economic problem.

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:30.949
Like there was once upon a time a gold rush.

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.589
So everybody rushed to find the gold.

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:38.239
Today if anybody wants to do that, people
will think, “Are you mad?

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:43.100
Must be joking.”

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:49.819
So the category of people today are of a different
level, we must be aware of that.

00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:56.850
We must understand that the category is very
different which perhaps media people don’t

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.480
understand so much.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.970
I don’t think they have any idea as to what
is the level of awareness of human beings

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.839
today in the West.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:14.420
They are still of that old school which was
busy fighting elections or strikes and this

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.720
and that - all nonsensical things.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:29.550
But the people who are aware are many, many
more than yet what we know of, that they are

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:37.499
seeking something very different that their
fathers and forefathers did not seek, because

00:10:37.499 --> 00:10:39.639
the times are such.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:48.449
Today, it’s a special time – special time
where many people have to get their Spirit.

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:57.689
But then again we are misled because people
who are trying to exploit this have found

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:09.200
a good market, and they come down to find
out how they can market their goods in this

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.389
new awareness of people.

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:24.449
We get enamored because we are still not fully
conscious or knowledgeable about what to expect

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.290
in your spiritual pursuit.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.730
And that’s how they come and befool us.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:41.389
We have cults and we have sects, but one must
understand that as you have grown through

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:48.660
amoeba in your evolutionary process, gradually,
from that to this level, the awareness has

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.120
to also grow the same way, in a traditional
way.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:01.499
It cannot be somebody like Freud coming up
and saying something new, that we accept.

00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:11.600
Suddenly, how can we deviate from all those
who talked of something very different from

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.480
what Freud has been talking?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:24.000
Because it’s a mind which is of course very
aware, but also it is what we call very right-sided

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.369
mind, as is described in the Gita they are
called as the people who are rajasikas, the

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:35.320
people who are in action.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.480
They live with the power of action.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:48.569
So the people who live with the power of their
action live with their egos, and ego likes

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:54.709
something new, some sort of a new stuff comes
in they think, “Oh, why not do that?

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:57.170
Try this, try that.”

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:05.449
It’s like a horse which wants to go into
every new direction and fails.

00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:13.959
It’s a very venturesome horse, I think,
and that’s how something new somebody says,

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.089
everybody jumps to it.

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:21.600
We are not new ourselves, we are ancient.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:34.100
And when we take to some new idea suddenly
we find after some time that we have to recoil

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.790
back, because these are all mental projections
and that’s how in every religion there have

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.610
been sects formed.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:52.379
Because, say Catholicism - Martin Luther who
was himself a realized soul saw that Pope

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:57.669
was doing all kinds of wrong things, so he
started a new sect.

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:05.420
But it’s a mental projection still, I would
say, though he was a realized soul.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.259
Then out of that came out I don’t know how
many churches.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:15.419
So now we have one Unification Church which
turned out to be another horrible stuff, then

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:21.269
we have Unity Church where they unite all
these sects – is all projections, all branches

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:24.029
of that mental movement.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:27.480
But the essence is lost.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:38.209
In the first case it was lost, and it was
completely forgotten in the last case.

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:39.930
So that’s how the sects were born.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.420
Now we find Pentecostals.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.089
The other day I was reading the harm it has
done to people.

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:52.419
We have all kinds of faiths - Seventh Day
Adventists.

00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:57.869
What does it matter what was the seventh day,
the Sabbath?

00:14:57.869 --> 00:15:04.339
Supposing you have your Sabbath day, say,
on the seventh day, will you become righteous?

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:07.489
Will you become virtuous?

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:11.399
Will you become your Spirit?

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:35.800
By changing a particular type of ideology
or thought, will you be transformed, will

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.279
you become great, will you become a super
human being?

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:38.279
No.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.279
Then what?

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:42.229
You think that by going from one sect to another
sect you’ll achieve something great, you

00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:50.379
will just form different social orders, that’s
all.

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:56.290
Then you have anti-culture, another sect formed
as a reaction.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.579
That also is another problem.

00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:06.439
All these venturesome ideas of this horse
takes you from places to places, and you think,

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:11.600
“Why whenever we try to do something why
we are committing the mistake?”

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:19.709
Because we have forgotten the fundamental,
and the fundamental is very simple, that you

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:27.360
have to seek your Spirit, and when you seek
your Spirit it is a spontaneous happening,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:35.970
it’s a living process in your evolutionary
process by which you become the Spirit.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.739
By mental projection you cannot.

00:16:39.739 --> 00:16:47.889
Then the people who took advantage of the
situation that there are so many seekers on

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:53.199
this Earth, they started all kinds of cults,
also.

00:16:53.199 --> 00:17:02.731
I’ve been talking against them since 1970
that “Don’t go to these cults.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:06.799
These are another ego-pampering stuffs.”

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:11.839
Suddenly they start a new idea – it appeals
to you.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:18.730
Suddenly someone says that “No, by leading
this kind of a life you’ll achieve God.”

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.209
You accept it.

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:21.949
Why not find out?

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:28.810
Since ages people have been writing about
the spiritual life.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.029
What does that mean?

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:33.120
How to achieve it?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.669
Why do you take to anyone who just says that
“This is so, this is so”?

00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:45.419
Because perhaps they have a nice circus or
a publicity.

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:53.540
There must be something that is so attractive
that people take to it.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:18:00.450
Or maybe it is some sort of a ego-pampering
that you want to join these cults and get

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.450
destroyed.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:09.220
There cannot be a cult for your assent.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.710
What cults did you follow to become human
beings?

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.880
The nature itself works it out.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.980
It is a spontaneous happening.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.750
But for a person who lives only with mental
projections, morning till evening you see

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.470
television or listen to radio, it’s nothing
but mental projection all the time, you see,

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.220
hovering on your head.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:39.139
You cannot think that there is something beyond
that mental projection which is the reality.

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:44.210
So you find reality horrifying, absolutely
horrifying.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:49.299
You have to pay the tax; you have to pay the
rates; you have to pay this.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:53.850
You have to be like this; you have to be dressed
up like this; you have to have clothes like

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.850
this.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.029
All kinds of pressures on your head.

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:58.090
So now what to do?

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.009
How to get out of this?

00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:03.390
This is reality for people.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:13.539
So then we accept the drugs and the alcohols
and things because we want to get out of it.

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:24.909
That gives definitely a sensation, hallucination;
but reality in itself is so beautiful, is

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:36.679
so surmounting all this, that we have to honestly
understand that if it is reality, it cannot

00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:38.150
be hallucination.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.990
It cannot.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.600
You cannot pay for it.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:55.980
You cannot follow somebody who says something
against the tradition of evolution.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.960
It has to be fundamental, what it has been
and will be.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:09.340
It has to be something that is integrating
everything, integrating all the religions,

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.710
integrating all the religious leaders, all
the great prophets and all the great incarnations,

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:21.630
otherwise it cannot be reality because reality
has to be one.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.830
It should unite everything.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:33.780
It cannot create a separate identity on mental
level.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:42.840
It may create on a spiritual level, maybe,
that people who get Realization, who have

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:55.250
got Self Realization, maybe the people form
a more coordinated concord among themselves,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:03.100
but they’re all the time worried about the
other people who are not yet in there – not

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:11.240
for money, not for lust, not for greed, but
only because they want to share the joy of

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.280
reality.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:20.230
This has to be first of all understood by
all those who are seeking that reality cannot

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:28.380
be a mental projection, neither can it be
a emotional projection which we can manage

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.380
ourselves.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.330
One moment we are in love, another moment
we are walking to the divorce cases.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.330
Why?

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.509
If there was some truth in that kind of a
love, why?

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:47.110
It is something beyond, which is eternal,
which doesn’t change, which overflows, is

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.110
promised.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.360
What about that?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.620
Why not seek that?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:22:00.919
Then you turn your eyes to find out where
it is described.

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:12.100
Vedas were written thousand of years back
and every Veda, whichever you read, the Upanishads

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:22.670
as they are called as the people where they
have described about human beings have talked

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:28.190
that you have to worry about your Spirit,
it’s the Spirit that is important.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:35.940
Then you have other people, in India we had
fourteen thousand years back some great poets.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.440
All of them have said the same.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:52.620
Then we have people in other countries like
Abraham, like Moses, we have Confucius, Lao

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.850
Tse.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.990
We have Krishna, Rama.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:05.750
All of them have said one thing, and one thing
that “You seek your Spirit.”

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:10.149
If so, then how?

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:13.370
We should again look back.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.019
It is described how to seek it.

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:28.260
It is described in Gita, but much before that
it is described in the Vedas very clearly

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.450
about the Kundalini and the seven Chakras.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:39.909
Nobody says in any book that when the Kundalini
awakens you become mad or you start jumping

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:42.970
like a frog.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:50.350
Recently I went to Pune, and there I was surprised
that the Brahmins of Pune, who are supposed

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:58.110
to be very learned people, were all suffering
from high blood pressure, from kidney troubles,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.380
from insanity.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.450
I mean name any disease, they had it.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.789
I said, “Why are they suffering like this?”

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:11.210
So there was one fellow called [Gumani, Gurumani,
or Gulumani ???] Maharaj who really came as

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.630
the killer of all these Brahmins, I think,
that they followed him.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:24.440
And their main person came to discuss with
Me about his religion, so-called.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.049
And he started asking Me, “Do you know about
“terno pai, erno pai”

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:32.550
I said, “What is that?

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.340
I’ve never heard.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.190
Where is it described?”

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.200
‘Oh, You have never heard about it?”

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200
I said, “No.”

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.409
“Do You know about shaktipath?”

00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:44.250
I said, “I’ve never heard about this.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.279
From where does it come?

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:47.279
Which book?”

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.509
“Oh, it’s from one book.”

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:49.990
I said, “Which book?”

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.690
“About sixty years back there was one Vishnutirth,
Swami Vishnutirth who wrote this book.”

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.279
I said, “Really?”

00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:59.309
He’s the only one.

00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:03.320
Only sixty years back this fellow comes up
from somewhere, writes down something new,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.639
“erno pai, terno pai.”

00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:08.809
All the Vedas, all the Shastras are all finished.

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:10.120
Bible is finished.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.440
Everything is finished.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.669
Only this fellow sixty years back comes up
from somewhere and talks about shaktipath

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:17.279
and you believe it.

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:21.440
All of you, the Brahmins, the educated, the
learned.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.160
I said, “Where do you see these words in
the Vedas?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160
Show Me.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.130
Where do you see them in the Patanjali Yoga
Shastra?

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.130
Show Me.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.130
Is it written anywhere?

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.130
“

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.130
He said, “We haven’t read them.”

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.130
I said, “What did you read?”

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.130
“This Vishnutirtha’s book.”

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.350
I said, “You are supposed to be learned
people in Sanskit.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:42.610
You read only this Vishnutirth who came only
sixty years back?”

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.929
How can it be?

00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:55.429
And all of them are so sick you won’t believe
it, and in My presence when they came they

00:25:55.429 --> 00:26:00.519
were in a very bad shape, absolutely in a
very bad shape as if they had taken cocaine

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:02.070
or something worse than that.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:08.720
Eyes were going up, their hands were moving
like this, all kinds of things.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.039
And I told them, “Please forgive Me.

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:13.039
Go to Vishnutirth or to his disciple, this
[Gumani, Gurumani, or Gulumani ???] Maharaj.”

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:22.760
And the only thing they did was not to eat
this, not to eat that, not to have relationship

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:34.440
with your wife, become like a dry bean, live
on a shoe string and then you become godly,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440
is it?

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440
It’s very simple.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.499
In India so many are like that already.

00:26:39.499 --> 00:26:43.940
Use your brains!

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.559
They are very brainy people.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:51.820
I said, “How could this man dominate you?”

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.340
So they came out with very intelligent answer
that “In the Vedas, you see, when we followed

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.799
the Vedas and what did we get?”

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:01.799
“All right.”

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:03.980
I said, “You didn’t get anything.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.749
But there’s something promised in the Vedas,
in the ancient books, that in Kali Yuga, at

00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:12.639
these modern times, you will get your Realization.

00:27:12.639 --> 00:27:17.120
Why didn’t you go for that?”

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.559
But this fellow says that through erno pai,
karuno pai - God knows all kinds of nonsensical

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:30.330
words, it has no meaning at all in Sanskrit
language - that you will get your Realization.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.970
All right, anybody says so, must you join
him?

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.159
You should have asked, “How do you get these
words?

00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:38.549
From where did you find them?”

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:43.009
You should have asked Mr. Freud, “From where
do you get your knowledge?”

00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:45.070
He, himself, was a drug addict.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.119
He, himself, was a horrible man.

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:49.519
He had bad relations with his mother.

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:55.570
He had a cancer, and he becomes your guru
instead of Christ?

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.769
Suddenly, and you accept him.

00:27:58.769 --> 00:28:05.779
Those people who deal on mental level cannot
talk of God.

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:07.669
They cannot understand God.

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:11.559
God can be only understood through your Spirit.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:20.309
Like your theologians here – theologians
– what do they understand about Christ?

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:26.899
They haven’t got power to talk about Christ.

00:28:26.899 --> 00:28:33.181
Just because they are elected, they are just
paid servants of the people to look after

00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:34.181
the churches, that’s all.

00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:35.181
They don’t deserve to be saints.

00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:40.019
Why are they so important?

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:44.059
At least in India nobody treats them as something
great.

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:47.580
They are just priests, finished.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.509
You have to be a saint to understand God.

00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:58.059
You have to be a realized soul to understand
His miracles.

00:28:58.059 --> 00:29:05.419
You cannot just become a theologian in a theology
school or somewhere and start talking about

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:06.419
God.

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:14.990
It’s blasphemous the way these people talk
about God and Christ.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.070
I don’t know how you tolerate it.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.119
In India they would have been stoned and finished
long time back.

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:28.399
They don’t know what God is, how can they
know about Christ?

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:36.419
It has been on and on from this Augustine
time and this Paul also another horrid fellow.

00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:42.960
I don’t know how they call him as Christian,
from where he becomes Christian.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.110
And that now they are not following Christ,
they are following Paul.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.830
Theologians, intellectuals cannot understand
God.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:59.309
He’s beyond your limited intellect; He’s
an unlimited personality.

00:29:59.309 --> 00:30:00.950
You have to jump into that.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:08.730
With your limited knowledge you can play your
horses of your politics, not of God.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.769
Such arrogance, such ego!

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:21.879
You are challenging the wrath of God on your
countries when you go about like this.

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:28.750
Please humble down yourself and understand
that God is beyond your petty intellect.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.390
First become your Spirit.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:37.850
You have to become your Spirit.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:46.940
By reading if you understand God, then he’s
not God.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.580
It’s clearly said “Atmanave Atmana Tattwa”.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.720
You see, through the Spirit you will know
God.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:00.530
Christ has said it so clearly to Nicodemas
that “You are to be born of the Holy Ghost.”

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.639
And Who is the Holy Ghost?

00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:06.160
These people who go to theological colleges,
are they Holy Ghosts or what are they?

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.850
They are nothing but ghosts of intellect.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.299
Beware of them.

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:20.169
This is another very subtle attack on reality.

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:24.419
And they all will have to suffer for it, they
must understand.

00:31:24.419 --> 00:31:35.169
You, those who are seeking, should seek your
Spirit and should understand that you are

00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:37.630
invited in the Kingdom of God.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:43.440
The time has come; this is the judgment time.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.929
This is the judgment and you can see it so
clearly.

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:52.390
So there is attack on the seekers.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:32:01.009
One, from ignorance because they don’t know
what to seek, how to seek, what to expect;

00:32:01.009 --> 00:32:11.549
and there is attack also from outside because
they think you are ignorant, because they

00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:14.739
think they know more than what you know.

00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:23.009
They don’t know anything about Christ, believe
Me - Who He was, why He came on this Earth,

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:31.720
and how He plays His role so perfectly within
ourselves.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.320
I would request you all to receive your Realization
first.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.379
There’s no argument about it; there’s
no discussion about it.

00:32:41.379 --> 00:32:49.110
Even if you try to argue it out – I may
be able to answer you, but that won’t give

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.010
you your Realization, your Kundalini has to
rise.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.669
Humble down in your heart.

00:32:56.669 --> 00:33:10.659
I went to a village where about three thousand
people came from all hills of Himalayas, very

00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:11.850
simple people.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:15.419
And they were waiting for this.

00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:20.379
I asked them, “How is it you were waiting?”

00:33:20.379 --> 00:33:22.639
“Oh, it is said.

00:33:22.639 --> 00:33:28.299
It’s said it, that Devi Jagaran will be
there in modern times.

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:30.999
We were waiting for You to come, Mother.

00:33:30.999 --> 00:33:36.309
Devi Jagaran is the awakening of the Goddess,
of the Kundalini.

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:39.590
The villages know about it.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.440
On the foothill of Himalayas they are waiting.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.320
In one day I got three thousand people realized.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.869
In this Birmingham, how many people there
are today who are new, who have come to receive

00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:52.869
their Realization?

00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:53.869
Very few.

00:33:53.869 --> 00:33:55.259
But theologians get all these lectures.

00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:59.200
They like to play with their mental projections.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.159
But beware, time is very short.

00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:07.820
Better get your Realization.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.889
Become the Spirit and then you will know that
God is not intellect, It is love.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:25.829
And love which is not limited – unlimited
love which is the most powerful thing in this

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:39.500
universe which you can become aware of and
you can become empowered with that great,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.600
unlimited love which just flows, acts, coordinates,
thinks, plans, works out everything.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.859
This All-Pervading Power about which you have
heard, you have to know That and get It.

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:52.560
You can’t pay for It.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.329
You can’t organize It.

00:34:56.329 --> 00:35:09.369
It has to work out like a living process within
you.

00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:14.109
May God bless you.

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:22.030
I would like to know if you have any questions.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:32.870
[Shri Mataji says aside, “Ice, I don’t
take ice.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:39.570
It is very cold water.]

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.940
Come along, come forward.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.530
There are lots of seats here.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:52.270
Who are sitting at the back, come along.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.040
Sit at here.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.290
Can you hear Me?

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:05.049
Is it all right?

00:36:05.049 --> 00:36:06.260
Have you any questions?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.859
Come along, this side.

00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:08.859
There’s room this side.

00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:14.339
Don’t sit on the ground.

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:27.740
There’s room here this side.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:33.099
Any questions?

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:46.780
Question: A man asks if it helps to be a vegetarian.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.839
Shri Mataji: No, no.

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:54.230
It has nothing to do with vegetarianism or
not.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.271
Christ was not a vegetarian.

00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:56.271
It’s all absurdity.

00:36:56.271 --> 00:36:57.271
Of course you have to eat whatever suits you.

00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:59.330
I would say that – whatever suits you.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.780
This vegetarianism is a fad.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.240
It’s just a fad.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:13.310
To believe that by eating some food you’ll
go to God is a wrong idea.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:18.320
But, of course, alcohol goes against your
awareness, you know that.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.870
But I don’t say, “Don’t take alcohol.”

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:26.410
You will just not take it, that’s all, because
you get the alcohol of God within you and

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.450
then you don’t want to take it.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:28.589
That’s a different point.

00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:31.440
But I won’t say just now that “Don’t
take it.”

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.119
But food has to be seen whatever’s suitable
for your body.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.960
I would say that Indians should take to meat.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.690
It would be better.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:55.450
And the Western people should take to vegetables,
it would be better for them, just to balance.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:16.020
Question: How do you become your Spirit?

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:23.730
Shri Mataji: That’s a very good question.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:38.020
That’s the question is - I’m saying it
is a spontaneous happening and that within

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:45.450
us is placed, if you see here in the triangular
bone, is the power of Holy Ghost within us,

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.460
which we call in Sanskit language as Kundalini.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.280
In Koran it is called as Assas.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.970
In every scripture it is described.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:07.500
And this Kundalini has to rise, this power
which is the desire power, which is the pure

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.589
desire power, because all other desires are
not pure.

00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:14.290
If they were pure, then you would have been
satisfied.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.750
But you’re not satisfied.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:22.650
So this pure desire is the desire to become
one with the Spirit.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:29.349
And this is within you, this force is within
you dormantly placed in the triangular bone

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:30.900
called as sacrum.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:38.070
That means the Greeks also knew the word sacrum
means “sacred.”

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:45.720
And this power has to rise within you, and
there are subtle centers above it, six centers

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:51.790
above and one center below through which it
pierces and you feel the Holy Ghost, which

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:58.960
is described by Christ and you feel the Cool
Breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.740
fontanel bone area which is the real baptism.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:17.130
And as a result of that you start feeling
your Spirit in your consciousness, means in

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.760
your central nervous system.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.710
You, yourself, feel it.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.460
That’s how you become the Spirit.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:29.289
That’s the only way it is sprouted.

00:40:29.289 --> 00:40:44.200
It’s a living process like if you want to
sprout a seed, you have to embed it into this

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.700
Mother Earth and spontaneously with the power
what Mother Earth has, it sprouts.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.089
In the same way it happens, and that’s how
I have to work it out.

00:40:56.089 --> 00:41:01.420
But later on when you get it and you become
established, you can do it yourself to others.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.380
Like one enlightened light can enlighten another
light.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.230
But the first light has to be enlightened.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:18.849
For that you can get some books from here,
but once you start reading books also I find

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:25.270
you become more bookish, so it’s better
to postpone the reading for some time.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.490
Better get your Realization first.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:33.290
Like I would say that when you want to put
lights on you say, “All right, switch on.”

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.569
It’s all built in there; it’s all done.

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:38.920
Only thing you have to switch on.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.579
And the whole thing becomes enlightened.

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:48.099
But I could first of all tell you all the
details about the history of electricity,

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:52.589
then all the organization that has worked
it out - would be a headache.

00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:58.890
Better have your light first.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:04.470
And then you’ll know all about it.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:08.049
And this is not I’m saying that is today.

00:42:08.049 --> 00:42:14.980
Has been said for thousands of years.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.740
That is how we become the Spirit.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:26.240
Christ didn’t tell us lies when He said
that “You are to be born of the Holy Ghost.”

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.400
He never said that any priest can put his
hand on your head and say, “Now you are

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.819
a Christian.”

00:42:32.819 --> 00:42:35.109
Did He say so?

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:36.820
He did not.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.540
That’s all artificial.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:45.400
That’s why children cry such a lot when
they’re baptized, I think.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.220
Like William Blake has said that “A priest
cursed me on my head.”

00:42:49.220 --> 00:43:09.640
Any other question, please?

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:26.010
Now we have to work it out.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:30.789
It’s very simple and it will work out in
no time.

00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:32.230
It works out.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:44.900
It will happen to you in no time but the problem
is, it’s a new experience and people actually

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:52.819
think that when you get an experience you
must jump or you should become like a mad

00:43:52.819 --> 00:43:53.819
person.

00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:57.860
I don’t know what things are expected.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:05.480
You become empowered, and unless and until
you use this power how will you know you’re

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.520
empowered or not?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.280
So to establish that power you take some time.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:18.940
Once you have established that power then
you can see yourself how you are blessed,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:26.589
that how this power is flowing through you
of God’s compassion, that how you are blessed

00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:36.300
in every way and how you, yourself, become
the source of joy – to yourself and to others.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:44.050
How you jump into a new awareness of collective
consciousness by which you can feel the problems

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:49.809
of others and your own problems, how you can
cure your problems and cure the problems of

00:44:49.809 --> 00:44:50.809
others.

00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:58.809
For this you have to have patience with yourself
for a little while and once you’re established

00:44:58.809 --> 00:45:09.910
you will see that you, yourself, become your
own master, your own guru.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:22.020
So to achieve it, we have to do few things
is to understand that we have to have, first

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.200
of all, desire.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.030
You and your freedom cannot be challenged.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:34.400
So you have to have intense desire to be the
Spirit.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.470
If you have that desire in your heart, it
works much faster.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:47.420
To express that symbolically we put the left
hand like this which represents the power

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.470
of desire and the right hand is the power
of action.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.842
We have to take out our shoes because the
Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:45:55.842 --> 00:45:56.842
We have to take out our shoes to take some
help from Mother Earth.

00:45:56.842 --> 00:45:57.842
Thank God here it’s not concrete, slightly
better than that.

00:45:57.842 --> 00:45:58.842
To put both the feet on the Mother Earth in
a parallel manner, and be comfortable - you

00:45:58.842 --> 00:45:59.842
have to be comfortable.

00:45:59.842 --> 00:46:00.842
Now supposing somebody is feeling uncomfortable
because of something that’s tight on the

00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:01.842
neck or on the waist, please loosen it a little
bit if you find that.

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:02.842
But if you’re comfortable, it’s all right.

00:46:02.842 --> 00:46:03.842
Or somebody has got a coat which is making
one uncomfortable, you can take it out.

00:46:03.842 --> 00:46:04.842
Attention should not be distracted towards
some discomfort to the body.

00:46:04.842 --> 00:46:05.842
That is important.

00:46:05.842 --> 00:46:11.180
Secondly, if you can take out your spectacles
will be better because here you don’t have

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:17.240
to see anything, you have to keep your eyes
shut.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.253
So please put both your feet on the Mother
Earth, your left hand towards Me like this,

00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:23.253
with the desire in the mind that we have to
be the Spirit.

00:46:23.253 --> 00:46:24.253
We are not yet complete till we become the
Spirit; we are not complete to understand

00:46:24.253 --> 00:46:25.253
God Who is absolutely complete.

00:46:25.253 --> 00:46:26.253
Now the right hand is to be used for the action.

00:46:26.253 --> 00:46:27.253
That is on the different centers we have certain
problems.

00:46:27.253 --> 00:46:28.253
In a village I don’t have to do all this.

00:46:28.253 --> 00:46:29.253
You’ll be surprised, it’s just like this,
(Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers) just like

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:30.253
that.

00:46:30.253 --> 00:46:31.253
I don’t have to do anything whatsoever.

00:46:31.253 --> 00:46:32.253
But we are little complicated so doesn’t’
matter.

00:46:32.253 --> 00:46:33.253
We have to remove our own hurdles by putting
our hands into different things.

00:46:33.253 --> 00:46:34.253
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi] Please
put your shoes at the back.

00:46:34.253 --> 00:46:35.253
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut, but
before that I’ll tell you the different

00:46:35.253 --> 00:46:36.253
centers we’ll try to clear out.

00:46:36.253 --> 00:46:37.253
One is on the heart because heart reflects
the Spirit.

00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:38.253
So that’s why one.

00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.253
Then secondly we’ll have to put our hand
on the upper part of the abdomen on the left

00:46:39.253 --> 00:46:40.253
hand side.

00:46:40.253 --> 00:46:41.253
The whole thing we are working out on the
left hand side because here resides the center

00:46:41.253 --> 00:46:42.253
that governs the mastery.

00:46:42.253 --> 00:46:43.253
Then below that is the center that governs
the true knowledge, the pure knowledge.

00:46:43.253 --> 00:46:44.253
Then here is the center on the left hand side
which is very important, because this is the

00:46:44.253 --> 00:46:45.253
center where when we feel guilty, condemn
ourselves, try to show that we are sinners,

00:46:45.253 --> 00:46:46.253
we are good for nothing, a blocket is built
up.

00:46:46.253 --> 00:46:47.253
And that blocket is very common in the Western
people, surprisingly.

00:46:47.253 --> 00:46:48.253
Whatever you may say there is ego, this blocket
of feeling guilty is too much.

00:46:48.253 --> 00:46:49.253
They all the time feel guilty for everything
that is nonsensical, or maybe little sensible

00:46:49.253 --> 00:46:50.253
also, but mostly nonsensical.

00:46:50.253 --> 00:46:51.253
So a blocket is built.

00:46:51.253 --> 00:46:52.253
That’s how you develop this angina troubles
and you develop other troubles like spondylitis

00:46:52.253 --> 00:46:53.253
and all that.

00:46:53.253 --> 00:46:54.253
So this is a very important point.

00:46:54.253 --> 00:46:55.253
At the very outset you must know that you
are not guilty of anything, and God’s power

00:46:55.253 --> 00:46:56.253
of forgiveness is so great that He can wash
up whatever wrong you have done.

00:46:56.253 --> 00:46:57.253
He’s quite capable.

00:46:57.253 --> 00:46:58.253
So don’t try to condemn yourself.

00:46:58.253 --> 00:46:59.253
Know that you are the temple of God and the
Light has to come within you.

00:46:59.253 --> 00:47:00.253
That’s all.

00:47:00.253 --> 00:47:01.253
So the hand has to be here, push back when
I tell you.

00:47:01.253 --> 00:47:02.253
Then the hand goes here - is the center here
is very important of Christ which is in the

00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:03.253
center of optic chiasma.

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.253
The center of Christ is there where you have
to forgive others.

00:47:04.253 --> 00:47:05.253
At the back is the center where you have to
ask for forgiveness, just to get over your

00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:06.253
guilt.

00:47:06.253 --> 00:47:07.253
And then you have to put your hand on top
of the fontanel bone area which is the soft

00:47:07.253 --> 00:47:08.253
bone in your childhood.

00:47:08.253 --> 00:47:09.253
Put your palm, just please put it just on
top of that.

00:47:09.253 --> 00:47:10.253
Stick out your fingers, press it hard and
move it seven times clockwise when I tell

00:47:10.253 --> 00:47:11.253
you.

00:47:11.253 --> 00:47:12.253
So this is what we have to do ultimately and
then you will see that the Cool Breeze will

00:47:12.253 --> 00:47:13.253
be coming out of this fontanel bone area.

00:47:13.253 --> 00:47:14.253
You have to certify yourself and then you
start feeling the All Pervading Power of God’s

00:47:14.253 --> 00:47:15.253
Love as Cool Breeze around you, on your fingertips.

00:47:15.253 --> 00:47:16.253
You have to know on your fingertips.

00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:17.253
Nobody else has to certify.

00:47:17.253 --> 00:47:18.253
You have to certify yourself.

00:47:18.253 --> 00:47:19.253
So now first of all we close our eyes.

00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:20.253
At the very outset we have to tell ourselves
that we are not guilty.

00:47:20.253 --> 00:47:21.253
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi] These
are uprooted people from India so you shouldn’t

00:47:21.253 --> 00:47:22.253
worry about them.

00:47:22.253 --> 00:47:23.253
Please have your right hand on your heart.

00:47:23.253 --> 00:47:24.253
Keep your eyes shut.

00:47:24.253 --> 00:47:25.253
Please have your right hand on your heart.

00:47:25.253 --> 00:47:26.253
On the heart is on the left hand side above
the stomach.

00:47:26.253 --> 00:47:27.253
Heart.

00:47:27.253 --> 00:47:28.253
Higher, it’s higher.

00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:29.253
Now, at this point you have to say, or you
have to ask Me a question, in your heart.

00:47:29.253 --> 00:47:30.253
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:31.253
Ask this question three times.

00:47:31.253 --> 00:47:32.253
If you want you can call Me “Shri Mataji”
or you can call Me “Mother”, whatever

00:47:32.253 --> 00:47:33.253
suits you.

00:47:33.253 --> 00:47:34.253
“Mother am I the Spirit?

00:47:34.253 --> 00:47:35.253
Mother am I the Spirit?”

00:47:35.253 --> 00:47:36.253
Ask the question three times.

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.253
Now, put this right hand on the left hand
side in the upper part of your abdomen.

00:47:37.253 --> 00:47:38.253
Please put this right hand, your fingers,
press them in, on the left hand side, in the

00:47:38.253 --> 00:47:39.253
upper part of your abdomen, that is stomach.

00:47:39.253 --> 00:47:40.253
Now , this is the center of the mastery.

00:47:40.253 --> 00:47:41.253
Keep your eyes shut.

00:47:41.253 --> 00:47:42.253
Now as you are the Spirit, you are your own
guide.

00:47:42.253 --> 00:47:43.253
So now ask the second question, “Mother,
am I my own master?”

00:47:43.253 --> 00:47:44.253
Three times.

00:47:44.253 --> 00:47:45.253
“Mother, am I my own guide?”

00:47:45.253 --> 00:47:46.253
“Mother, am I my own guru?”

00:47:46.253 --> 00:47:47.253
Ask a question within yourselves.

00:47:47.253 --> 00:47:48.253
Three times.

00:47:48.253 --> 00:47:49.253
After asking this question please don’t
open your eyes, and put your right hand – left

00:47:49.253 --> 00:47:50.253
hand to be all the time towards Me and the
right hand in the lower part of your abdomen

00:47:50.253 --> 00:47:51.253
on the left hand side.

00:47:51.253 --> 00:47:52.253
Please put your right hand in the lower part
of your abdomen, your stomach, on the left

00:47:52.253 --> 00:47:53.253
side, on the left side.

00:47:53.253 --> 00:47:54.253
Press it hard.

00:47:54.253 --> 00:47:55.253
Now this is the center of our true knowledge.

00:47:55.253 --> 00:47:56.253
As I told you, you are free, I cannot force
things upon you.

00:47:56.253 --> 00:47:57.253
So please, you have to ask for it.

00:47:57.253 --> 00:47:58.253
The true knowledge of Divine Power, how it
works, here you have to ask six times, “Mother,

00:47:58.253 --> 00:47:59.253
please may I have the true knowledge, the
true technique?

00:47:59.253 --> 00:48:00.253
May I have the pure knowledge?”

00:48:00.253 --> 00:48:01.253
Ask the question six times, please.

00:48:01.253 --> 00:48:02.253
Keep your eyes shut, please.

00:48:02.253 --> 00:48:03.253
Don’t open your eyes.

00:48:03.253 --> 00:48:04.253
Ask this question with full confidence, please.

00:48:04.253 --> 00:48:05.253
Keep your eyes shut, please, all of you.

00:48:05.253 --> 00:48:06.253
Now, with your asking the Kundalini starts
getting alert.

00:48:06.253 --> 00:48:07.253
The Power of Desire wants to ascend.

00:48:07.253 --> 00:48:08.253
So you have to make proper seats or arrangements
for the Kundalini’s rise.

00:48:08.253 --> 00:48:09.253
So what do you do is to put your hand now
on the upper center that is placed on the

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:10.253
left hand side of your abdomen, in the upper
part.

00:48:10.253 --> 00:48:11.253
Now, in the upper part of your stomach, on
the left hand side you place your fingers.

00:48:11.253 --> 00:48:12.253
Now press them.

00:48:12.253 --> 00:48:13.253
Now here you have to say with full confidence,
that the Kundalini wants to rise but you show

00:48:13.253 --> 00:48:14.253
your full confidence by saying ten times,
because this center has got ten petals, ten

00:48:14.253 --> 00:48:15.253
times.

00:48:15.253 --> 00:48:16.253
“Mother, I am my master.

00:48:16.253 --> 00:48:17.253
Mother, I am my guide.

00:48:17.253 --> 00:48:18.253
Mother, I am my own guru.”

00:48:18.253 --> 00:48:19.253
Please say it with full confidence.

00:48:19.253 --> 00:48:20.253
This is the place is created by all the great
masters, satgurus as they are called, within

00:48:20.253 --> 00:48:21.253
us.

00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:22.253
They have to be awakened by this confidence
that you say.

00:48:22.253 --> 00:48:23.253
Ah.

00:48:23.253 --> 00:48:24.253
Ten times, please.

00:48:24.253 --> 00:48:25.253
[Shri Mataji rubs Her hands together and blows
on Her palms]

00:48:25.253 --> 00:48:26.253
Now raise your right hand on to your heart.

00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:27.253
On the left hand side it is.

00:48:27.253 --> 00:48:28.253
Please raise your right hand on to your heart.

00:48:28.253 --> 00:48:29.253
Now here, with full confidence again in yourself,
you have to say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:30.253
Twelve times.

00:48:30.253 --> 00:48:31.253
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:48:31.253 --> 00:48:32.253
Twelve times.

00:48:32.253 --> 00:48:33.253
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:48:33.253 --> 00:48:34.253
Twelve times.

00:48:34.253 --> 00:48:35.253
Because you are, but have confidence.

00:48:35.253 --> 00:48:36.253
Don’t feel guilty.

00:48:36.253 --> 00:48:37.253
As I told you, God is the Ocean of Love.

00:48:37.253 --> 00:48:38.253
He’s the Ocean of Compassion, but above
all He’s the Ocean of Forgiveness.

00:48:38.253 --> 00:48:39.253
With full confidence, please say, “Mother
I am the Spirit” twelve times.

00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:40.253
Now, with full confidence again, put your
hand on your neck on the left hand side from

00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:41.253
the front, from the front.

00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:42.253
Don’t take it backwards because is easier
from the front.

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.253
And push it towards the back.

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.253
Hold it tight, hold it tight.

00:48:44.253 --> 00:48:45.253
Here is the problem where you have to know
that you are not guilty at all.

00:48:45.253 --> 00:48:46.253
Here with full confidence please say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:48:46.253 --> 00:48:47.253
Please say it sixteen times with full confidence
in Me, yourself.

00:48:47.253 --> 00:48:48.253
You’re not guilty at all.

00:48:48.253 --> 00:48:49.253
Believe Me, you’re not guilty of anything
– is all conditionings and all kinds of

00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:50.253
things, the norms that people have created,
is all their mental projections.

00:48:50.253 --> 00:48:51.253
You’re not guilty at all.

00:48:51.253 --> 00:48:52.253
Believe Me.

00:48:52.253 --> 00:48:53.253
But if you still think you are guilty, you
better have punishment of saying it hundred

00:48:53.253 --> 00:48:54.253
and eight times.

00:48:54.253 --> 00:48:55.253
You have to be pleasantly placed because you
have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:48:55.253 --> 00:48:56.253
You have to be pleasant about it.

00:48:56.253 --> 00:48:57.253
Not to be disgusted.

00:48:57.253 --> 00:48:58.253
Now, sixteen times please say, “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.”

00:48:58.253 --> 00:48:59.253
Believe Me you are not guilty.

00:48:59.253 --> 00:49:00.253
From your heart please say, “I am not guilty.”

00:49:00.253 --> 00:49:01.253
Believe Me.

00:49:01.253 --> 00:49:02.253
Believe Me.

00:49:02.253 --> 00:49:03.253
Now, now raise your hand to your forehead
across and press it on both the sides as we

00:49:03.253 --> 00:49:04.253
do when we have headaches.

00:49:04.253 --> 00:49:05.253
Now here you have to say from your heart,
from your heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

00:49:05.253 --> 00:49:06.253
But this is from your heart.

00:49:06.253 --> 00:49:07.253
How many times is not the point.

00:49:07.253 --> 00:49:08.253
Now some people say that’s difficult to
forgive.

00:49:08.253 --> 00:49:09.253
But it is again a mental idea that we forgive
someone, or we don’t forgive someone.

00:49:09.253 --> 00:49:10.253
Actually, we don’t do anything.

00:49:10.253 --> 00:49:11.253
But when we don’t forgive, then we play
into the hands of people who want to do us

00:49:11.253 --> 00:49:12.253
harm.

00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:13.253
So put your hand on top of your forehead across,
forehead across and say, “Mother, I forgive

00:49:13.253 --> 00:49:14.253
everyone” from your heart.

00:49:14.253 --> 00:49:15.253
Please say it.

00:49:15.253 --> 00:49:16.253
You wanted to have your Realization, isn’t
it?

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:17.253
Please, go ahead with it.

00:49:17.253 --> 00:49:18.253
Otherwise then you’ll say “We didn’t
feel it.”

00:49:18.253 --> 00:49:19.253
Come along.

00:49:19.253 --> 00:49:20.253
As you asked the question, please go ahead.

00:49:20.253 --> 00:49:21.253
Everybody’s doing it.

00:49:21.253 --> 00:49:22.253
What’s so special about you?

00:49:22.253 --> 00:49:23.253
Just do it.

00:49:23.253 --> 00:49:24.253
Otherwise you’ll say, “We didn’t get
Realization.”

00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:25.253
Then I’m not responsible.

00:49:25.253 --> 00:49:26.253
You are here to get your Realization.

00:49:26.253 --> 00:49:27.253
Be sensible.

00:49:27.253 --> 00:49:28.253
What are you going to lose?

00:49:28.253 --> 00:49:29.253
If you are seekers, please do it.

00:49:29.253 --> 00:49:30.253
[Shri Mataji rubs Her hands together] It’s
not proper that you should watch others.

00:49:30.253 --> 00:49:31.253
It’s not civil.

00:49:31.253 --> 00:49:32.253
Now put your hand on top of your head.

00:49:32.253 --> 00:49:33.253
Here – we have missed one center because
I don’t think you need to do that one where

00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:34.253
you have to ask for forgiveness – but just
put your hand on top of your head and press

00:49:34.253 --> 00:49:35.253
it hard on the fontanel bone area and move
it in a clockwise manner.

00:49:35.253 --> 00:49:36.253
Here now, again, I cannot cross your freedom,
so you have to say, “Mother, please give

00:49:36.253 --> 00:49:37.253
me my Realization.”

00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:38.253
Seven times.

00:49:38.253 --> 00:49:39.253
“Please give me my Realization, I want it.”

00:49:39.253 --> 00:49:40.253
I cannot force it.

00:49:40.253 --> 00:49:41.253
Place your hand on top of your head, top of
your head, on the top, and press it hard,

00:49:41.253 --> 00:49:42.253
and move it.

00:49:42.253 --> 00:49:43.253
Now, seven times.

00:49:43.253 --> 00:49:44.253
Now, bring down your hand, please.

00:49:44.253 --> 00:49:45.253
Slowly open your eyes.

00:49:45.253 --> 00:49:46.253
Slowly open your eyes.

00:49:46.253 --> 00:49:47.253
Now see, there are no thoughts in the mind.

00:49:47.253 --> 00:49:48.253
Just see for yourself.

00:49:48.253 --> 00:49:49.253
Watch Me without any thought.

00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:50.253
Just watch Me.

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:51.253
Put your left hand on top of your head.

00:49:51.253 --> 00:49:52.253
Left hand.

00:49:52.253 --> 00:49:53.253
And right hand towards Me, and see if there’s
a Cool Breeze coming in.

00:49:53.253 --> 00:49:54.253
Just move it up and down.

00:49:54.253 --> 00:49:55.253
It’s very subtle.

00:49:55.253 --> 00:49:56.253
Here, here.

00:49:56.253 --> 00:49:57.253
Here, the fontanel bone is here.

00:49:57.253 --> 00:49:58.253
All right?

00:49:58.253 --> 00:49:59.253
It’s very subtle.

00:49:59.253 --> 00:50:00.253
Now, change your hand.

00:50:00.253 --> 00:50:01.253
Put your left hand towards Me.

00:50:01.253 --> 00:50:02.253
See with the right hand.

00:50:02.253 --> 00:50:03.253
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone]

00:50:03.253 --> 00:50:04.253
Now change, see it with the other hand.

00:50:04.253 --> 00:50:05.253
Carefully.

00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:06.253
Without thinking.

00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:07.253
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone] Feeling
it?

00:50:07.253 --> 00:50:08.253
There’s a little breeze coming out.

00:50:08.253 --> 00:50:09.253
Are you?

00:50:09.253 --> 00:50:10.253
Little bit here in front.

00:50:10.253 --> 00:50:11.253
 
Now, those who are feeling the Cool Breeze,

00:50:11.253 --> 00:50:12.253
raise both the hands.

00:50:12.253 --> 00:50:13.253
Let Me see.

00:50:13.253 --> 00:50:14.253
Those who have not felt, should not.

00:50:14.253 --> 00:50:15.253
You should be honest about it.

00:50:15.253 --> 00:50:16.253
All right.

00:50:16.253 --> 00:50:17.253
Now, all of you raise your hands and ask a
question, “Is this the Breeze of the Holy

00:50:17.253 --> 00:50:18.253
Ghost?’’

00:50:18.253 --> 00:50:19.253
Ask a question three times.

00:50:19.253 --> 00:50:20.253
“Is this the Breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:50:20.253 --> 00:50:21.253
Now, put your hands like this.

00:50:21.253 --> 00:50:22.253
See if It is coming in your hands also.

00:50:22.253 --> 00:50:23.253
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.253
It’s very subtle.

00:50:24.253 --> 00:50:25.253
Now, put down your hands and see are you feeling
It in your hands, some sort of a cool breeze.

00:50:25.253 --> 00:50:26.253
If you are not feeling, doesn’t matter.

00:50:26.253 --> 00:50:27.253
We’ll work it out.

00:50:27.253 --> 00:50:28.253
Doesn’t matter.

00:50:28.253 --> 00:50:29.253
Don’t get upset.

00:50:29.253 --> 00:50:30.253
All right?

00:50:30.253 --> 00:50:31.253
Now those who have come for the first time,
please raise your hands because people will

00:50:31.253 --> 00:50:32.253
come and see you if you are feeling the cool.

00:50:32.253 --> 00:50:33.253
First time.

00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:34.253
Please raise your hands.

00:50:34.253 --> 00:50:35.253
Are you feeling the Cool Breeze.

00:50:35.253 --> 00:50:36.253
No?

00:50:36.253 --> 00:50:37.253
You are?

00:50:37.253 --> 00:50:38.253
All right.

00:50:38.253 --> 00:50:39.253
Now those who have come for the first time,
please raise your hands because people would

00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:40.253
like to see you.

00:50:40.253 --> 00:50:41.253
All right.

00:50:41.253 --> 00:50:42.253
Just see.

00:50:42.253 --> 00:50:43.253
Now, we have here people who have got Realization,
who are established people and they would

00:50:43.253 --> 00:50:44.253
like to see if your chakras are all right
because they’ll just feel your Cool Breeze.

00:50:44.253 --> 00:50:45.253
Now the thing is, this is what, exactly what
happened to Christ’s disciples.

00:50:45.253 --> 00:50:46.253
When they felt the Cool Breeze of the Holy
Ghost, they started using their hands because

00:50:46.253 --> 00:50:47.253
the chakras and all that, they could feel
raising of the Kundalini and they started

00:50:47.253 --> 00:50:48.253
talking in the terms of the centers.

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.253
So people thought they were mad.

00:50:49.253 --> 00:50:50.253
Because this is a new language, a new subject
for them.

00:50:50.253 --> 00:50:51.253
So people thought they were mad.

00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:52.253
Exactly the same way you will also feel everything
on your fingertips.

00:50:52.253 --> 00:50:53.253
Now, don’t think about it.

00:50:53.253 --> 00:50:54.253
Again, I would request you to raise your both
the hands those who have come for the first

00:50:54.253 --> 00:50:55.253
time so others could come and feel it, if
there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your

00:50:55.253 --> 00:50:56.253
head or not.

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:57.253
If it is not coming, doesn’t matter.

00:50:57.253 --> 00:50:58.253
All of you who have come for the first time,
who have come for the first time, please raise

00:50:58.253 --> 00:50:59.253
your hands.

00:50:59.253 --> 00:51:00.253
Is important because they will all take over.

00:51:00.253 --> 00:51:01.253
Come along.

00:51:01.253 --> 00:51:02.253
Forward.

00:51:02.253 --> 00:51:03.253
You have?

00:51:03.253 --> 00:51:04.253
You have come for the first time?

00:51:04.253 --> 00:51:05.253
All right.

00:51:05.253 --> 00:51:06.253
You’ve come before?

00:51:06.253 --> 00:51:07.253
All right.

00:51:07.253 --> 00:51:08.253
Doesn’t matter.

00:51:08.253 --> 00:51:09.253
You raise your hand.

00:51:09.253 --> 00:51:10.253
Raise your hand.

00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:11.253
Also, those who have not felt the Cool Breeze,
raise your hands.

00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:12.253
All right.

00:51:12.253 --> 00:51:13.253
Can you have a look now?

00:51:13.253 --> 00:51:14.253
Some of you should go and see.

00:51:14.253 --> 00:51:15.253
Now the lady who asked Me a question, Adita
can you see her?

00:51:15.253 --> 00:51:16.253
She didn’t do anything and she had neighbors
who didn’t do anything at all.

00:51:16.253 --> 00:51:17.253
So just see if she’s felt the Cool Breeze.

00:51:17.253 --> 00:51:18.253
She has felt it.

00:51:18.253 --> 00:51:19.253
This lady has come for the second time, she
said.

00:51:19.253 --> 00:51:20.253
Just see her, Danny.

00:51:20.253 --> 00:51:21.253
Liver.

00:51:21.253 --> 00:51:22.253
Liver.

00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:23.253
Let her put her right hand, left hand on the
liver.

00:51:23.253 --> 00:51:24.253
Now don’t think about it.

00:51:24.253 --> 00:51:25.253
You cannot think about it.

00:51:25.253 --> 00:51:26.253
You try to remain in thoughtless awareness.

00:51:26.253 --> 00:51:27.253
[Shri Mataji says aside “ May God bless
you.”]

00:51:27.253 --> 00:51:28.253
Just see this gentleman who came for the first
time, this gentleman.

00:51:28.253 --> 00:51:29.253
Yes.

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:30.253
See him, if he’s felt the Cool Breeze on
his head.

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.253
Now I have to request you one thing – that,
though you have felt it, you have to establish

00:51:31.253 --> 00:51:32.253
it.

00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:33.253
Now don’t waste your Realization.

00:51:33.253 --> 00:51:34.253
See these people, all of them, they have got
their Realization, they’re helping people,

00:51:34.253 --> 00:51:35.253
that’s how we have to save this world.

00:51:35.253 --> 00:51:36.253
And now you will know that what’s the meaning
of your life, why are you here, what’s the

00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:37.253
purpose.

00:51:37.253 --> 00:51:38.253
Did this gentleman come?

00:51:38.253 --> 00:51:39.253
You felt it?

00:51:39.253 --> 00:51:40.253
Still see him.

00:51:40.253 --> 00:51:41.253
They have got?

00:51:41.253 --> 00:51:42.253
He’s got it, you can see so clearly.

00:51:42.253 --> 00:51:43.253
Eyes start sparkling.

00:51:43.253 --> 00:51:44.253
Hah.

00:51:44.253 --> 00:51:45.253
Is it better?

00:51:45.253 --> 00:51:46.253
It’s better now.

00:51:46.253 --> 00:51:47.253
You think too much.

00:51:47.253 --> 00:51:48.253
Don’t you?

00:51:48.253 --> 00:51:49.253
All right.

00:51:49.253 --> 00:51:50.253
For that what is to be done she’ll tell
you.

00:51:50.253 --> 00:51:51.253
It’s very simple to get rid of it.

00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:52.253
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi and Hindi]

00:51:52.253 --> 00:51:53.253
Just see.

00:51:53.253 --> 00:51:54.253
Kalab [not sure how to spell this name], just
see him.

00:51:54.253 --> 00:51:55.253
There are some new people here?

00:51:55.253 --> 00:51:56.253
Are there?

00:51:56.253 --> 00:51:57.253
Some Sahaj Yogis should come and see this
side.

00:51:57.253 --> 00:51:58.253
Have you come for the first time?

00:51:58.253 --> 00:51:59.253
No.

00:51:59.253 --> 00:52:00.253
No.

00:52:00.253 --> 00:52:01.253
You are Sahaj Yogis.

00:52:01.253 --> 00:52:02.253
Just see here.

00:52:02.253 --> 00:52:03.253
Some Sahaj Yogis should come and see there.

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.253
Come along.

00:52:04.253 --> 00:52:05.253
Um.

00:52:05.253 --> 00:52:06.253
Better?

00:52:06.253 --> 00:52:07.253
Better.

00:52:07.253 --> 00:52:08.253
Don’t think.

00:52:08.253 --> 00:52:09.253
Just don’t think for awhile.

00:52:09.253 --> 00:52:10.253
Ah.

00:52:10.253 --> 00:52:11.253
Is he all right?

00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:12.253
Ask him to keep his eyes open.

00:52:12.253 --> 00:52:13.253
More on the left.

00:52:13.253 --> 00:52:14.253
More on the left.

00:52:14.253 --> 00:52:15.253
Right to the left you should put it.

00:52:15.253 --> 00:52:16.253
Right to the left.

00:52:16.253 --> 00:52:17.253
Yah.

00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:18.253
Better.

00:52:18.253 --> 00:52:19.253
These two ladies here.

00:52:19.253 --> 00:52:20.253
All right?

00:52:20.253 --> 00:52:21.253
Good.

00:52:21.253 --> 00:52:22.253
How many beautiful people there are in this
world, just see.

00:52:22.253 --> 00:52:23.253
You have to just find them.

00:52:23.253 --> 00:52:24.253
Hah.

00:52:24.253 --> 00:52:25.253
It’s better with that, very beautiful, isn’t
it?

00:52:25.253 --> 00:52:26.253
That’s the fact.

00:52:26.253 --> 00:52:27.253
That’s the fact.

00:52:27.253 --> 00:52:28.253
They are beautiful.

00:52:28.253 --> 00:52:29.253
Ah.

00:52:29.253 --> 00:52:30.253
Better.

00:52:30.253 --> 00:52:31.253
Flowing better.

00:52:31.253 --> 00:52:32.253
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi and Hindi] All
right?

00:52:32.253 --> 00:52:33.253
It’s good.

00:52:33.253 --> 00:52:34.253
[more Hindi]

00:52:34.253 --> 00:52:35.253
Down below, little.

00:52:35.253 --> 00:52:36.253
Pat, there’s a gentleman in front of you
here.

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.253
Just see what about him.

00:52:37.253 --> 00:52:38.253
One ahead.

00:52:38.253 --> 00:52:39.253
Here.

00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:40.253
No, in there all right.

00:52:40.253 --> 00:52:41.253
Yes, this gentleman.

00:52:41.253 --> 00:52:42.253
Just find out about him.

00:52:42.253 --> 00:52:43.253
Yes, please find out.

00:52:43.253 --> 00:52:44.253
Next to that one.

00:52:44.253 --> 00:52:45.253
Did you feel the Cool Breeze?

00:52:45.253 --> 00:52:46.253
Beg pardon?

00:52:46.253 --> 00:52:47.253
What did he say?

00:52:47.253 --> 00:52:48.253
He didn’t feel it?

00:52:48.253 --> 00:52:49.253
Should feel it.

00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:50.253
What do you say?

00:52:50.253 --> 00:52:51.253
It’s all right.

00:52:51.253 --> 00:52:52.253
Next to that one also.

00:52:52.253 --> 00:52:53.253
He’s got it.

00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:54.253
He’s got it.

00:52:54.253 --> 00:52:55.253
Keep your eyes open, please.

00:52:55.253 --> 00:52:56.253
Just watch Me without thinking.

00:52:56.253 --> 00:52:57.253
Just watch Me without thinking.

00:52:57.253 --> 00:52:58.253
Hah.

00:52:58.253 --> 00:52:59.253
Better.

00:52:59.253 --> 00:53:00.253
[Shri Mataji laughs] Don’t think.

00:53:00.253 --> 00:53:01.253
Don’t think.

00:53:01.253 --> 00:53:02.253
With thinking you cannot be there.

00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:03.253
This is the first mantra, first chanting,
“Don’t think, don’t think.”

00:53:03.253 --> 00:53:04.253
By thinking we reach nowhere.

00:53:04.253 --> 00:53:05.253
[Shri Mataji laughs again] It’s maddening,
I tell you.

00:53:05.253 --> 00:53:06.253
The lady who asked the question, how is she?

00:53:06.253 --> 00:53:07.253
She’s what?

00:53:07.253 --> 00:53:08.253
Hah.

00:53:08.253 --> 00:53:09.253
Good?

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:10.253
That’s very good, Ian.

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.253
Those who have come today and are not yet
attended to, please raise your hands.

00:53:11.253 --> 00:53:12.253
Anyone.

00:53:12.253 --> 00:53:13.253
Hah.

00:53:13.253 --> 00:53:14.253
Great.

00:53:14.253 --> 00:53:15.253
You’ll knock down ten years at least.

00:53:15.253 --> 00:53:16.253
Ten years younger, minimum.

00:53:16.253 --> 00:53:17.253
I am sixty-three years of age, Myself.

00:53:17.253 --> 00:53:18.253
I might be the oldest among all of you.

00:53:18.253 --> 00:53:19.253
Good?

00:53:19.253 --> 00:53:20.253
It has nothing to do with age or anything.

00:53:20.253 --> 00:53:21.253
Good, he’s got it, you can see.

00:53:21.253 --> 00:53:22.253
These ladies also, they have got it.

00:53:22.253 --> 00:53:23.253
All right?

00:53:23.253 --> 00:53:24.253
Good.

00:53:24.253 --> 00:53:25.253
Thank you very much, all of you.

00:53:25.253 --> 00:53:25.257
May God bless you.

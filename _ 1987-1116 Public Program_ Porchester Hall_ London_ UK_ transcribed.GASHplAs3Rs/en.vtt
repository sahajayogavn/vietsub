00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.090
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:54.350
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.500
Because it is benevolent for us, not for others.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.199
We are seeking the Truth for ourselves, not
for others.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:14.539
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is.

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.280
We can not change it, we can not organize
it, we can not maneuver it.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.490
It is what has been and will be.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
And what is the Truth?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.479
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:46.790
You are not this body, you are not this mind,
you are not this ego, and you are not this

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.930
conditioning.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.829
You are the Spirit.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.500
But so far you have been a humane being.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.840
But to be humane being itself is a very great
thing.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.869
Is the greatest thing – to be a humane being.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:18.299
Perhaps we have not realized the value of
our life because we do not know what we are.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:31.540
The way we waste our time, waste our energies,
waste our attention on things, which are senseless,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:40.370
because we still have to understand the greatness
of our being.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:52.680
Humane beings are made with such care, so
beautifully, such delicate working of the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.430
Divine from ameba to this stage passing through
various stages, such a beautiful thing has

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.209
been created as a humane being.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.849
But first we must have this attention to our
Self that there must be something.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:18.459
It can not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING],
it can not be something just a chance.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.780
Is a wrong idea to play with.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:36.200
If the gravitation force of the Earth or anyone
of the galaxies changes, then be disaster,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.870
absolute disaster.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.450
So many things in the cosmos, if you study,
the coefficients that works out, the different

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.870
balancing and the different weights and the
movements of the different bodies show us

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.549
that there must be some purpose.

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:03.450
And they do not trouble us; it’s all as
if made for the stage for humane beings.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.379
That the humane beings have to come on the
stage and all the preparation is made for

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.170
the great drama.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.739
I think it’s high time that great scientists
should look at it and start wondering why

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.880
is it the way it is made.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.950
Why we are so much looked after.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:34.960
The whole cosmos seems to be within ourselves
as if we have buttons, which move the cosmos,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.469
which control the cosmos.

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:46.690
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:57.009
It has been said practically in all the Scriptures
that you have to seek your Self; you have

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.170
to find your Self.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:09.530
Though I think many of this Scriptures have
been little bit changed and have been used

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:17.030
for certain purposes, still they could not
get over this point that you have to become

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.570
the Self, you have to be born again.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.950
But that is not an artificial thing.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.130
We are humane beings not artificially made.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.210
We are made really by some sort of a living
force from ameba.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.200
We are not just made with some sort of a thinking
or a mental projection.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.860
It is not a mental projection by which we
have been humane beings, it is something spontaneously

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.530
happening, a living force within us, which
has brought us to this stage - with a purpose,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.440
with a meaning.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.650
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.810
Many people ask Me, “What was the need to
give this freedom to humane beings?”

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.940
It was very necessary.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.479
If you have to have the ultimate freedom you
must know how to deal with it.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.940
You have to understand.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.000
Of course, humane beings have to make mistakes.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.290
To err is humane.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:39.110
And we have to understand that this trial
– error and trial and error business – has

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.699
made us understand, also those who have not
understood must understand, that there must

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:53.590
be a wiser or surer way to achieve that goal
of Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:05.210
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly, we have had no system by which

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.990
we could know ourselves.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.500
But think of a computer that is a humane being
is.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.900
As soon as you see Me you know I am there.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.319
You don’t have to go for programming, you
don’t have to consult anything, you don’t

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:30.230
have to use any kind of computer or some sort
of a complicated machinery, automatically,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.900
spontaneously in a split of a second you know
that I’m standing before you and talking

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.900
to you.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.470
Such a computer we can not create.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.150
But the Divine has created such a great computer
and that is the humane being.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.169
And this humane being is the only one who
is going to achieve that higher state, which

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:55.260
we call as the spiritual state of the Self.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:03.569
Because in the science they deal with the
tree, I should say, the outside, but they

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:07.160
can not go into the roots.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.610
To go into the roots you have to become a
subtler being.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.419
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:17.730
what are your roots are.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.980
And that is what is Self-Realization.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:28.470
When you become subtler then only you can
go into your being and can find out what actually

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.470
you are.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:38.240
Also to look after a tree, which has not know
its roots, is a very difficult thing.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.990
What happens is that when you do not know
your roots and you start growing, and growing,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:55.170
and growing you go very deep down into that
where you find that you have lost your way.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.470
Actually you are not going deeper.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.800
You are spreading outside more and more.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.370
And then once you start going to extremes
because of your freedom you lose your way.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:11.550
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.650
You are all going to face a shock.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.680
This is going to happen, that is going to
happen.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.140
But actually it is absolutely in your hands
because the whole of the cosmos is within

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.140
you.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.860
The cosmos is working under your control complete.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.679
It is absolutely looking after you.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:41.270
Every element is looking after you to preserve
you, to guide you, to take you to the right

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.270
thinking.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.550
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.880
This is a very big condition and there where
we fail to understand.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.709
Even there are many who say, “There is nothing
like Divine” and, “There is nothing like

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:56.939
God.”

00:09:56.939 --> 00:10:01.299
In Russia I’ve been and I’ve been to China
and all the communist countries and they are

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:04.560
in a way partially justify it.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.080
Because what they found, those people who
talk of God, those who say that, “We believe

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:19.880
in God” and those who say that, “We believe
in religion”, can be irreligious.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.790
Anybody who can call himself a Christian,
Hindu, Muslim, say, Farsi, anything, is capable

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.110
of any sin.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.150
Whatever he wants to do he can do it.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:37.300
Nobody can say that, “Because he was a Christian
he could not do it”.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:46.540
So the whole concept of religion becomes a
mental projection again an artificial thing.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:56.640
But if a person is a Self-Realized person
he goes beyond that, beyond temptations, beyond

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.240
any kind of domination of any habits.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:08.060
He becomes a very strong person, very powerful
person and extremely compassionate.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.690
His compassion is active.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.150
Is not a compassion that, “I’ll form a
charitable institution, which lends money

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.120
to people”, is not like that.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:29.070
The being itself emits compassion and this
compassion acts, acts and works out.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:35.310
For example you become like a light which
gives light to people and to yourself.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.160
You know others and you know yourself.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.120
That is the light of the Truth and unless
and until that happens one should not say

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:51.100
that, “I’m a Self-Realized soul” or,
“I am a twice born” – is artificial.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:58.360
So what you have to understand that we are
living in a relative world.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.440
We talk relatively.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.500
We have to be in the absolute world, where
the Truth is absolute.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:13.329
There now before you I’m standing, you know
very well that I’m wearing a sari, which

00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:14.559
is white.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:20.390
But it’s a relative still because somebody
will say, “Oh, maybe it’s white”.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.930
Somebody will say, “It’s of white”,
somebody will say like that.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:35.179
Still you know something, but to know it absolutely,
meticulously the right thing, you have to

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:36.179
be the Spirit.

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:41.880
But what you know is much more than these
eyes can see or this nose can smell.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:50.870
Is much more, much more explicit, much more
clear cut.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.780
Like a person who is suffering, say, from
some disease.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:13:02.110
A child is suffering from some disease and
they don’t know what the disease is.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.360
So they have to go many various kinds of tests
and for that the gentlemen, the father, or

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.190
the mother, they have to pay a lot of money.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.800
They go on finding about the child, what’s
wrong, what’s wrong, what’s wrong.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.010
They can not find it, what’s wrong with
the child.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.870
And they are so upset about it and within
three days a child dies and still the diagnoses

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.870
is not coming.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.910
Is a very common thing.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:35.300
But when you are a Self-Realized soul you
can know what’s wrong with the child, exactly

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:43.270
you can put down your finger on the problem
that he has.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.270
Now how does it happen?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:49.270
Here is already told you about the charkas
that we have, the centers within us.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:56.610
These are the centers, which on one side control
the cosmos, on the other side control us,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:02.390
give knowledge and on the other side they
give us the knowledge about others.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.790
These centers are within us.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:10.059
Now when I’m telling you all this you have
to have an open mind of a scientist.

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:14.640
We shouldn’t just deny it because in your
concept it doesn’t fitting.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:21.430
But like a scientist please see to it that
if it is proved you have to accept that this

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.360
is so.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.650
Now these charkas are within you, these centers
are within you, and these centers communicate

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:36.939
to you through your fingertips what’s the
matter with a child.

00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:42.330
You can feel it on your fingertips, now five,
six, and seven centers, right side, seven

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.330
centers.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.480
(Shri Mataji points to the chakra projections
on Her left and right palms.)

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.610
The right side has got the seven centers,
if they are decoded properly and if you know

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.930
what is the decoding is, putting the hand
towards a child, for a Realized soul it is

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.300
very easy to see where is the problem.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:01.809
And as soon as he finds a problem and he knows
how to cure it he can cure people without

00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:02.809
going to doctors.

00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:09.260
Sahaja Yoga has cured, I must say, I don’t
want to claim it because I don’t want to

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.880
open a hospital.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.680
We are here to create doctors and not patients.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.410
So even some patients who have come to us
have become doctors today in a way that they

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.370
diagnose it on their fingertips.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:32.080
As Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that, “At
the time of your resurrection your hands will

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.080
speak”.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:39.130
But still nobody wants to know about it, that’s
called as a resurrection time, as [SOUNDS

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.130
LIKE – Kayama], nobody wants to talk about
it.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:46.400
“Your hands will speak and will give evidence
and witness against you”, clearly He has

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:54.650
said it, I must say, He’d done such a lot
of work on the Self-knowledge; as Christ has

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.230
also said so many things.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.240
But people don’t want to look at that side.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:09.910
Like to say that, “We must suffer” itself
is a nonsense, I think, how can you.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:17.189
Any God who is a compassionate Father would
like His children to suffer to meet Him?

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:20.809
I mean, it doesn’t going to logic at all.

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:25.500
But people accept this funny concept of sufferings.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.680
What about Christ?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.970
He suffered for us, isn’t it?

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.690
Isn’t it that He suffered for us?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.050
If so, is has He left something for us to
be done, to be completed more than He has

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.049
suffered?

00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:51.770
He has suffered for us and He has done the
job fully.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:58.440
We don’t have to do any more about it.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.660
He carried the cross.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.480
People make Him look like a TB patient, even
worse than that, just bones and the skins.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:14.290
It’s very surprising, how can you conceive
Christ like that?!

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:23.699
Anyone of the people who say they are very
healthy people, let them carry the cross and

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:25.419
we’ll see.

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:34.679
It is so contradictory about Christ, there’s
surprisingly that He should say that you have

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:38.000
to suffer.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Same about Jews.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.300
I just don’t understand why should they
say that you have to suffer if their God is

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300
kind?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:55.020
Same about all other organized; all these
organized or perverted people who say that

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.490
you have to suffer.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.200
Suddenly people become vegetarians, suddenly
they become fasting.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.700
In India though we have to fast in any case
because of lack of food, but they have fasting

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.700
days.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.630
There are some people who fast at least five
days in a week.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.630
They fasting.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.630
What is the need to fast?

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.670
If you ask for fasting you’ll have to fast
all your life.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.990
That’s what God gives you, “You fast now,
you want to fast?

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.610
All right, have it fasting.”

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.330
We are asking for trouble.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.740
You want to be miserable?

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.760
All right, be miserable.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.810
You want to be unhappy?

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.930
All right, be unhappy.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:37.600
You find people coming out of congregations,
which are supposed to be very religious so

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.110
miserable looking.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.380
How can it be?

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:46.600
It has to be joy, it has to be happiness.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.940
Just think of it, how can we ever believe
such things what we have believed for ages,

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:59.300
ages, ages, and it can not go out of our heads,
that we have to suffer.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.120
How long, how many years, how many lives?

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.120
Nothing is written anywhere.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.140
You better go on suffering and make others
suffer also with it.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.610
If some person is like that in your family
you’d like to run away with that boredom,

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.460
because he’s suffering for nothing at all
and (Shri Mataji laughs) he don’t understand

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.660
why is he suffering.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.520
So you want to run away from such a person.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.970
And all this kind of ideas we have accepted
for ages now.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.550
And that has led us to a big confusion about
God.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.970
Then we take to things which give us joy.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:44.650
Actually they are not, they are just flippant
pleasures.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.661
We can not enjoy anything in life, really
we can not.

00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:52.020
We can see the way people are now going on
for such sensational things.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.100
The reason is there’s no joy.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:00.930
The sensitivity to joy is so reduced that
I sometimes fear with all that they are doing

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:06.090
they so fed up, that they may have to put
electrodes in the limbic area to get the joy

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.600
instead.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:17.620
They have become so very (Shri Mataji smiles)
so very insensitive to anything, they’ll

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:25.530
not laugh, they’ll not smile, they are so
full of closed hearts and frightened things,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.160
whatever they said about humane beings.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:39.090
Now first thing you have to know – you don’t
have to suffer at all.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.580
Secondly, you don’t have to judge yourself.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.690
Let your Kundalini rise and judge you.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.150
You don’t start judging yourself and condemning
yourself.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:50.320
And the another fashion, which is very common,
is to feel guilty.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.930
From the very beginning you start, “I am
afraid”.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.980
What are you afraid of?

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:05.200
You have to have all the courage, all the
blessings, and all the confidence.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.880
You are a humane being and this is the message
I want to tell you that you are a humane being

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.980
and you have to be the Spirit.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.670
And once you are the Spirit you’ll be surprised
the blessings will be showering upon you.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.610
In these modern times should talk about these
things is out of date.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.990
But it is predicted that this will be said
and this will be done.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:35.780
For us it is important first of all to know
our own glory, our own truths, and about how

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.190
we are built and how others are built.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:45.020
Once you know that first of all the peace
within is established.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.160
Unless and until there is peace within what
do you talk of this peace organization and

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.050
Peace Nobel Prize?

00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:02.750
I’ve seen the people who have gotten Nobel
Prizes are the most hot-headed so much that

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.200
you have to talk to them with a barge pole
in between.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.480
Any time they are up to jump on you, you can
not challenge them; even talking to them is

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.750
a difficult situation.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:21.370
So how are they going to have this peace foundation
when they are themselves so shaking?

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.830
Then you have other things talking about – the
love, the love.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.050
Full of lust and greed.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.670
They love your purse, not you.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:41.500
When you talk of love, love is a thing that’s
detached.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:48.990
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to all
the leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.670
all the fruits and comes back, is not attached.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:23:00.250
If it’s get attached to one fruit the tree
will die and the fruit will die too.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:07.430
So this Pure Love or the Divine Love is detached,
that’s why it acts, it works.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:16.550
A person who is a Realized soul is such a
pure personality that even a glance of such

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.250
a person can do lots of things.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:28.390
Even a thought of such a person in the attention
can do so many things, bring about so many

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.390
changes.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.600
So this is the time of our transformation.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:41.230
We have to become a higher personality; the
transformation has to take place.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.870
At the time of Easter we give people eggs.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.070
Perhaps people do not know why do we give
them eggs at the time of Easter.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.590
But about Christ is written in our Scriptures
that He was an egg to begin with.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:04.480
Of course, He was much more before that, but
to begin with He was the God of innocence.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.200
But then He came as an egg.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.080
And then He was divided into two halves.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:19.920
The one half, which incarnated, and which
transformed this Earth.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.240
So the resurrection is the transformation.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:32.770
Like an egg, if we are bound by our conditioning
and by our ego, we break through that shell

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.820
and become a bird, which is really a free
bird.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.060
Only thing, the bird has to know how to fly.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:47.140
Now this is, again I’m saying is the living
process of the living nature, of the living

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.520
Power of Love.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.020
It is not something artificial.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:58.780
In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken in this
hall I don’t know how many times might before

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.830
and again today there’s a chance to speak
to you.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:08.020
What I have to say, that it is important the
becoming.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:14.230
Is not important: you can not become a member
of Sahaj Yog, you can not pay membership,

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.870
you can not pay for your Realization.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.880
How can you pay?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:23.300
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth to
sprout the seed, does She understand?

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.650
Because She has the power She sprouts the
seed.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:36.330
If you give Her money or read something before
Her, it makes no difference.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:41.740
But once you get your Realization you start
understanding how many powers you have.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:48.930
And the greatest power is of compassion and
detached love.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.740
These seven chakras are within us, which are
to be enlightened by the awakening of the

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.220
Kundalini about which Dr. Spiro has already
told you.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.830
Now in this short time I can not cover up
the whole subject.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.400
I must have given at least more than thousand
lectures in English language.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:14.270
But I would request you one thing that forget
about what you have learned so far.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:22.120
About your conditionings because if you had
achieved anything out of that I was not necessary.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:31.200
Now you have to see with a clean slate, as
they say, what you can achieve in this lifetime,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.070
which is the most important thing, is to be
achieved.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:44.440
Of course, where’s a lot of things that
should really make you more tempting about

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.490
it.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.000
Firstly, that you get rid of all your illnesses.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.110
Most of the illnesses can be cured – if
they are at an early stage – by Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:03.360
Most of the mental illnesses can be cured
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.420
Your material problems can be solved by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.530
Your spiritual problems like going to wrong
gurus and wrong people whatever you have accumulated

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.480
within you can be corrected.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:22.710
But the highest of all that you become sensitive
to joy.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.320
Then you start seeing joy in everything.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.800
You don’t have to think that, “Oh, this
is the thing which is marvelous”.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.800
No.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.720
It just happens, you see it is.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.370
Just you enjoy without thinking about it.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.380
You become a peaceful personality.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.800
You become a dynamic personality.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.450
Your are not spade by other veils of things,
like some fashion coming up, then some sort

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:55.910
of a nonsensical idea coming up, then some
medicine coming up and you treating yourself

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.780
and getting to trouble.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.080
You just rise above all the these things at
a higher level and you start see everything

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.070
as a witness.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:10.350
You become the witness of all the jokes that
are going on and you just watch it and you

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.030
think, “What’s all this?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.820
Is just a play”.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:20.550
Many people have said that, “Mother, You
always laugh so much and You have always smiling

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.380
face, so the people are not going to take
You seriously”.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.690
I said, “I don’t want them to be serious”.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.070
There’s not going to be any seriousness
needed.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.900
What are you serious about?

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.210
You should be happy.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.300
It’s fun.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.510
We have to be happy people.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.520
We have to be happy.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:43.580
Most people who think, they are very guilty,
should punish themselves by saying, “You

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.990
are not guilty, you are not guilty” 108
times.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.040
That’s what we have in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040
Is just the myth.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.760
All these are myths; we are working with myths
and making our lives miserable, which is meant

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:03.440
to be joy, happiness and all the overflowing
blessings of the Divine.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:11.550
Whatever I’m telling you about we have within
ourselves all the great powers hidden of our

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:18.120
brain, of our liver, of our heart, – they
are to be enlightened.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.160
And then in the light you see everything.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.910
But as in this room you have so many lights
you have to just push in one button and the

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.960
whole thing comes out.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.640
In the same way it happens.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.070
But if I start telling you about the history
of electricity in the dark and all about how

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:39.470
it came here and what all happened, you’d
be just fed up with it.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:44.970
So what we are doing is to tell you that let
us put on the button first, you better have

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:49.250
your light and see in that light if it is
true or not.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:54.840
If it is true you have to understand and accept
it honestly.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.960
You have to be honest to yourself that is
the main point I’m trying to tell you.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.270
We are not to play about with ourselves and
play about with our conditionings.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.660
We have to be honest and to get to our properties
that are within our selves.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.060
I’m not here to oblige you at all, there’s
no obligation.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.720
Is just like a catalyst, I would say, and
you become the catalyst oneself once you get

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.830
your Realization.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:26.070
And you can do all that I can do, it’s very
easy and very simple.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:30.180
May God bless you all.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.180
(Aside) Now, should we have questions or what?

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.180
I find most of you were just ready for getting
Self-Realization.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.750
Not only that, but I think you all capable
of that.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:31:22.730
But still there must be some people who must
be want to ask questions.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.290
I would only request – don’t be aggressive
with Me, there’s no need.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:33.660
I’ve not come here for votes, nor for any
money, nor for anything.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:38.480
I’ve just come here to give you your own
keys.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.830
Out of Love that I am.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.610
So please try to understand Me.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:50.630
I’m not here to take, I mean, anything from
you.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:57.760
Just to show you what you are and you’ll
be happy to know that you are something great.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:05.610
So may God bless you, I would like you to
ask Me questions related to Self-Realization

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.700
and not to waste the time of so many who look
so anxious to have their Self-Realization.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:18.740
Those who do not want to do any meditation
after this, which will take hardly ten minutes

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.559
for you to get your Realization, because the
journey is three to four feet only – from

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.559
here to here.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:27.880
(Shri Mataji shows the distance from Mooladhar
to Sahasrara Chakra with Her hand.)

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880
That’s all.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.420
So, I would just say, that you will all get
your Realization in no time.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.840
Should get your Realization, but do not try
to be uncivil.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.490
If you do not want to have it, you should
leave the hall and leave others in peace.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.610
That would be very kind of us.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.380
And not to see and watch, we don’t need
such people here.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.980
Those who want to have Realization can sit
down or others have freedom to go, but not

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.120
freedom to sit here.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:06.910
So I would request you to be kind and civil
to others who want to receive their Realization.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.390
Any questions, please.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:15.860
Q.: [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.850
What’s it?

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:46.450
A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he said that Dr. Spiro
couldn’t complete his talk about how the

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.340
germinating principle works.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.390
Could You say something to finish of what
he said?

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.309
Shri Mataji: Generating principle?

00:33:56.309 --> 00:33:57.380
The Sahaja Yogi: Germinating.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.130
Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I would say,
it is spontaneous.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:11.560
Now that should explain a little bit how does
a seed germinate.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.960
You have the seed and you put it in the Mother
Earth, all right?

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:22.490
And it germinates because it’s all built
in it, this is all built in it, all this is

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:23.649
built in it.

00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:30.220
And in the triangular bone you have got this
Kundalini, which is placed within you in 3,5

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.740
coils of an energy, which is a residual energy.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:41.890
Which is actually the power of your pure desire.

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:46.710
Because the desire that we have otherwise,
all the desires, are not pure.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.510
What’s why they are not satiable in general.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.720
We get one thing, we want to have another.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.659
We get the another thing, you want to have
the third thing.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:01.079
So this is the power of pure desire.

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:10.369
And this pure desire is described in the Bible
as Holy Ghost, in the Koran as [SOUNDS LIKE

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:19.680
– Asas] and in the Indian Scriptures as
Adi Shakti, as the Primordial Mother.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.880
So She is the power of God as called as the
Primordial Mother.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:33.869
Now this Primordial Mother is settled in our
triangular bone while the Spirit which is

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:37.640
the reflection of God Almighty is in our heart.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:47.100
But the seat of the heart is on top of your
head – here – on the fontanel bone area,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.660
which is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit
language.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:57.740
And also when we talk of baptism we try to
bless there, but it’s artificial.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:06.130
Real baptism is when this Kundalini, which
is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti, the reflection

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:13.320
of that, rises within you piercing through
these centers, piercing through the fontanel

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:22.000
bone area and actualizes the experience of
this personal experience and gives you a cool

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.990
breeze coming out of your head.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:28.130
Actually the cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel it, and then you feel it everywhere,

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.140
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:40.020
And that is the subtle of the subtlest, which
is the syntheses of all the powers, which

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.470
works everything out.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:49.710
Like you can say, in the sulfur dioxide we
have in the molecule of the sulfur dioxide

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.230
we find that there is pulsation of the vibrations.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.840
Who does what?

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.900
We say electromagnetic.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.350
But the electromagnetic is one part of the
same power.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.300
So this power we can broadly divide into three
things.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:11.160
In the first power what we call as the power
by which we desire.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:19.650
The second power by which we act and the third
power by which we ascend.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:31.070
All the synthesis of all these powers, all
these powers are in this Kundalini which meets

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:37.030
the Spirit because the seat of the Spirit,
as they call the Pitha, is on top of your

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:42.600
head and that’s how the whole attention
you can see like a sari it is supposing the

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.359
attention is spread here and the Kundalini
rises, rises like that (Shri Mataji puts Her

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:49.131
finger under the sari on Her chest and erects
it like a tent pole), pierces through this

00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:51.930
at and the whole of this attention becomes
enlightened.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.450
That’s how your attention becomes enlightened.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.200
This is in short I’m telling you.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:03.900
But as I told you we have got My lectures
on all detailed way how it works out, it’s

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.160
quite a detailed thing.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.290
But in the first lecture it will be quite
boring for you.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:13.490
So I think I better tell you this much, that
it’s a spontaneous happening and can happen

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:36.590
to all of you.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:53.910
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:54.910
The Sahaja Yogi: Do the first stages in Sahaja
Yoga consist of meditation and how they beneficial

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.910
physiological changes?

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.270
Shri Mataji: No, it is, you see, we do not
understand the meaning of meditation actually.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.940
You are not to meditate, but you are in meditation
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.860
You become meditative by temperament.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:10.280
Now, I would suggest like this that in the
beginning why I said you have to meditate,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.950
because I would like to tell you actually
that word is not so suitable, but I said that

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:22.000
you have to little bit cooperate with Me how
to help your Kundalini to rise.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.220
That’s the process we are going to have
in a very simple words.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.420
But I said meditate because that’s all could
make the smaller way of saying things.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:38.450
But actually in Sahaja Yoga the practice of
Sahaja Yoga is very different from any kind

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.030
of meditation, of concentration or anything.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:48.270
There are very simple ways by which you have
to correct your left or right side and to

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.859
be in the center.

00:39:50.859 --> 00:39:53.690
And then when you are in the center the growth
take place.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:40:00.020
Is very simple and luckily we are going to
have next Thursday a very good workshop where

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.310
they will tell you all the details how it
has to be done.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.420
And they’ll solve all your questions and
all your problems there.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:14.600
And lots of people are going to be in that
place where you’ll find solutions to all

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:22.290
these questions you ask.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:41.510
Thursday they are going to have a very good
workshop.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:47.280
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:40:47.280 --> 00:41:02.430
Shri Mataji: [YES or FIRST], sickness can
be cured if you become Self-Realized.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.790
Actually you don’t go to doctors then anymore,
you become a doctor yourself.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.270
So the physical sufferings can be, this [NOT
AUDIBLE – way ?]. Now the collective suffering

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:17.180
comes by the stupidity of humane beings, by
the ego of humane beings, of wrong ideas,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.260
you see.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:24.320
Like a Hindu fighting a Sikh and a Muslim
fighting a Muslim and a Christian fighting

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.270
the Jews or all the sorts of nonsense.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:32.730
And also the capitalist fighting the communists.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:37.369
Actually I should say I’m a capitalist because
I have certain powers and I’m the greatest

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:38.570
communist because I must distribute it.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.290
This is the real power which has to be distributed.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.539
What is the money power to be distributed?

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:45.539
– Useless thing.

00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:47.300
Money doesn’t give you any sense.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:53.309
So is the combination of everything, the synthesis
of everything you’ll find and that’s how

00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:57.240
you are surprised that the sufferings just
disappear.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:04.910
Also now you might say that, “What about
the sufferings of the nature?”

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:13.080
People who are Realized souls never get those
suffering things because you see this full

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:18.440
cosmos is within them, they are looked after.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.080
This is at a humane awareness.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.109
But at the spiritual awareness you become
beyond sufferings.

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:32.210
And Christ is to be awakened within you, that’s
the points is.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.690
Because Christ is not awakened within you.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:42.840
When the Christ, you know, in this chakra
– this center is Agya chakra, here – is

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.620
bestowed the Deity of Christ.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:51.180
Now here if you can see in the map there is
they have shown on one side the ego, another

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.570
side – the superego, means the conditioning.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:02.510
Now when this chakra is awakened meaning the
Christ within us is awakened, then He sucks

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.770
in our karmas.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:08.360
That’s why they say that He died for our
sins.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:14.350
Then He also sucks in our conditioning, both
the things.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:25.240
He is placed in the middle of the brain you
can say where is the optic chaisma crossing

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:31.030
and He looks after the pituitary and the pineal
body.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:36.710
That’s how He controls both the things within
us and He sucks in.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.030
And when He sucks in there’s an opening
that takes place on our fontanel bone area

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.240
and through that then the Kundalini pierces
through.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.270
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:53.300
The Sahaja Yogi: How can you keep your Self-Realization
if you are not in touch with the collective?

00:43:53.300 --> 00:44:09.122
Shri Mataji: You can not.

00:44:09.122 --> 00:44:11.290
You have to keep some connection with the
collective.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.040
It’s like say nowadays it’s autumn you
have seen.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.849
In autumn what happens?

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:23.350
A bark like a cork develops between the leaves
and the tree.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.420
And such a leaf falls off and dies.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.260
You have to be in the collective, you can
not keep your Self-Realization without collectivity.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.390
Is very important to be with the collective.

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:39.970
This is one point people fail, because they
think they’ll lose their individuality.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.640
Is a wrong idea.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.740
Actually when the leaf dies it has no individuality.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:50.609
On the contrary, when it is on the tree you’ll
be surprised, that one leaf can not tally

00:44:50.609 --> 00:44:53.350
with another leaf in the whole world.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:58.090
Such an individual thing it is.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:04.400
It is I would say unity in diversity, complete
unity in diversity.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.670
Because that is the variety is the one that
gives beauty to this world.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:13.570
Otherwise if we are all sort of dressed of
the same way, walking the same way, it will

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.540
be such a boring company.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.570
Is there any question?

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:24.330
Such a rapport.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:29.359
It’s beautiful people today.

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.869
All right.

00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:41.920
So now, as I’ve requested you, those who
would like to go, should go.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.050
Because when we do this we all have to close
the eyes and people are not even willing to

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.050
do that.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.850
So the thing is that the Divine is not going
to fall at out feet, isn’t it?

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.470
We have to be little humble about it.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:02.170
If we don’t have that humility is better
we should try other methods and then come

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.510
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:11.330
Because Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant
people, for people who think knowing of themselves.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:23.840
Is meant for people who want to get their
Self-Realization.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:31.710
Now a simple thing we have to do, all of us,
which is also sometimes not liked by people

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.520
when I tell them – we have to take out our
shoes.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.970
Because this Mother Earth is going to help
us a lot.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.450
She’s the one who is giver of everything.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:45.119
So we have to take out our shoes and touch
the Mother Earth.

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:59.390
You can keep your socks on with your both
the feet.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:33.710
Put both the feet separately because there
are two powers separately on the Mother Earth.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:39.070
Those who are sitting on the ground are all
right as they are, they need not put their

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:48.980
feet like this, they can sit in a Sahaja asana,
means in a way that is relaxed, not to put

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.440
legs on top of another row or anything.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.150
Any stress on your body is not needed.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:48:00.119
You have to be comfortable to be straight,
sitting straight, not putting your neck back

00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:09.839
or forward, just sitting straight, that’s
all.

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:17.320
One promise has to be there in your heart,
that you will after Realization respect your

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:26.030
Realization and grow like a tree and should
not be the like the parable of the seeds that

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:32.570
some seeds fell on a rock and some who sprouted
also got lost.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:40.430
I would request you very-very earnestly and
with a great concern that you have to look

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:44.060
after your Self-Realization and your growth.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:52.920
As we do not take any money from anyone, we
don’t have very elaborate places or elaborate

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.820
centers, so whatever is available is there
for you.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:04.820
But that is God’s place and you have to
come there to get all the information, the

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:09.400
knowledge about the Self.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:22.250
I hope you will not treat it with just a side
issue, but the main object of your humane

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.320
assent.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:30.450
You don’t have to pay for it; you don’t
have to do anything else.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:40.570
Moreover, we are all the time trying to save
time and that is why the time has to be spent

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:45.840
is been collective and enjoying the joy.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.190
May God bless you all.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.634
So both hands have to be like this, to begin
with.

00:49:53.634 --> 00:50:01.360
This is because as I told you these are all
sympathetic centers which are to be enlightened

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:08.320
first of all, so the information goes to the
Kundalini that the Kundalini is to be awakened.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.810
This is first thing we have to do.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:19.740
Now, secondly, we have to facilitate the movement
of the Kundalini even if she’s awakened.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:28.200
And for that I will tell you how to put your
hand into various centers to the various centers

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.711
so that you can yourself facilitate.

00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:35.990
I would like one of you to get up and show
this better.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:37.690
Yeah.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:44.710
Now Dr. Spiro will show you also and I will
also that first you have to put your hand

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.470
to your heart where resides.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:50.800
Now left hand towards Me and right hand on
the heart.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.910
Left hand towards Me.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:59.280
Now to your heart and here resides the Spirit.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:05.750
We work only on the left hand side, because
that is the side of our desire and put the

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:13.250
left hand like this symbolically meaning that
this is the power of desire and we want to

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.340
have our Self-Realization, expression of that.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:26.970
Now the second chakra is on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:38.940
This is the center of your mastery by which
the mastery over this power of love or Divine

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.020
vibrations you achieve and manifest through
your being.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:47.210
Is just starts working like through our eyes
we can see the light.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:55.710
In the same way, once you become the master,
you can feel, you can know everything about

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:58.940
yourself and about others.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:09.010
Then you have to take down your right hand
to the lower part of your abdomen.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:19.160
This is the one, which is working out our
pure knowledge, knowledge, which is absolute

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.430
and pure.

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:27.180
This center is very important and by some
unauthorized people if some people have tamper

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:33.500
it we have to nourish it by putting our right
hand towards it.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:41.230
Then again we go back into the upper part
of the abdomen.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.750
Then we go back to our heart.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:54.500
Now here we go back to the left hand side
of our neck, here, like this from front.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.940
Many people tried this side (Shri Mataji pointed
to the back side of Her neck).

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.940
No.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:03.410
You have to try from front and then turn your
head to your right, like this.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:12.859
Now this center catches when we feel guilty
and now I find quite a lot catching in this

00:53:12.859 --> 00:53:13.859
audience.

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:21.580
So please for the sake of your Self-Realization
forgive yourself, forgive yourself, forgive

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.580
yourself.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:30.680
Now, please now stretch your hand like this
and put it on top of your forehead.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.510
This is the center of forgiveness, – here.

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:38.070
And press it on both the sides, like this.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:46.692
Now you have to take this hand on the back,
rest your head on that, put the head up.

00:53:46.692 --> 00:53:58.400
And then you have to take out your hand again
and stretch it like this.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.450
Fully stretched.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:05.160
The center of your palm is to be placed on
top of the fontanel bone area.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.610
You might bend your head a little, would be
better.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:16.930
Just there, which was a soft bone in your
childhood, and you have to press your scalp

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:23.710
and move it about seven times slowly in a
clockwise manner.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:35.310
That’s all we have to do.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:40.900
But we must press it hard and the fingers
must be pushed back nicely so that we can

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.390
press our palm nicely.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:44.640
All right.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.900
That’s all is to be done.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.460
[INAUDIBLE WORD – Principally ?]

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.609
Now we have to close our eyes.

00:54:54.609 --> 00:54:58.240
Please don’t open your eyes till I’ll
tell you.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:06.570
Because the attention will be attracted inside
and please you can take out your glasses.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:11.160
The other day one lady who was quite blind
I think and she started seeing this, I mean,

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:15.609
you know, things happen like that.

00:55:15.609 --> 00:55:18.330
I would request you to take out your glasses.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:19.350
It helps you.

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:25.150
And you keep your eyes shut till I’ll tell
you, please don’t open your eyes.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:33.880
It is how you are going to help yourself and
also you will know how to all the time raise

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.690
your Kundalini.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:42.930
It’s very simple method, which I’m telling
you.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:49.800
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
like this and right hand on your heart.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:56.349
Left hand towards Me and right hand on your
heart.

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:59.630
Here, now close your eyes.

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.440
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.900
So please ask Me question within yourself,
a very fundamental question, you can call

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:15.010
Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:19.839
Ask this question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:27.700
Is a very fundamental question here to ask.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.619
Ask this question three times.

00:56:32.619 --> 00:56:40.599
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your
guide and master.

00:56:40.599 --> 00:56:47.260
Please put your right hand in the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, on

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:58.020
your stomach on the left hand side and press
it hard and ask a question here three times

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:02.390
again, “Mother, am I my own master?

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:06.070
Mother, am I my own master?

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.000
Mother, am I my own master?”

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.330
Ask this question in your heart.

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:32.640
Now, we move our right hand, move it down
into the lower part of your abdomen on the

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.820
left hand side.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:41.230
Now here, please keep your eyes shut, please
keep your eyes shut and don’t move too much.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:52.730
Here you have to know that I respect your
freedom and I can not force you to have the

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:53.820
pure knowledge.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.640
You have to say that you want it.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:11.589
So here you please say, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge” six times, because

00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:17.000
this center has got six petals.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:26.900
So please say six times, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge”.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:35.200
With this asking the Kundalini starts rising,
because she knows you want it.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:46.230
Now to facilitate her movement we go back
to the higher chakra and take our hand to

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:50.910
the upper part of the abdomen on the left
hand side and press it hard.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:59:01.410
Now, with full confidence we have to say ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master”.

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:09.119
Say it with full confidence so the Kundalini
will rise, “Mother, I am my own master”.

00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:14.950
Please say it ten times.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:24.660
This will correct your spiritual domination
if somebody has dominated you spiritually

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:29.540
in the sense that they have misguided you
spiritually.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.370
“I am my own master”.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:53.920
Now, raise your right hand to the heart.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:58.200
Here resides the Spirit.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:13.230
So with full confidence say twelve times,
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:15.590
Have confidence in yourself.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:24.870
We have to know, that the Divine is the ocean
of love and compassion.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:33.260
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness
and we can not commit any mistakes, which

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:38.310
the Divine can not forgive.

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:51.470
So please forgive yourself, forgive yourself
fully, and raise your right hand in the corner

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:57.220
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your
head to the right.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:08.450
And here with full confidence you say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:14.410
Please say it, very important and as I said,
if you still feel guilty, you can punish yourself

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:18.910
by saying it hundred and eight times.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:25.810
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:31.510
of God.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:41.960
You have to love yourself and respect yourself.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:02:03.590
Sixteen times please say it.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:12.300
Now raise your hand and put it on your forehead
across.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:17.300
Put it on your forehead across.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.500
This is the center of forgiveness.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:34.480
So please here 
you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”,

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.250
from your heart.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:40.630
You might say it is difficult, but it is a
myth.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:45.119
Whether you forgive or you do not forgive
you do not do anything.

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:48.849
But if you do not forgive then you play into
wrong hands.

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:56.089
So to get over all the loads you just say
from your heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:02:56.089 --> 01:03:01.119
It’s not important how many times.

01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:06.690
Press it on both the sides please.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:23.130
Now take back your hand, and put your hand
on the back of your head, and raise your head

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.349
on that.

01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:27.950
Move your head upward.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:36.890
Now here for your own satisfaction only, without
counting any mistakes or guilt you can say,

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:44.520
“Oh, Divine, if I have made any mistakes,
please forgive me”.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:52.980
For your own satisfaction, don’t feel guilty
about it.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:58.410
In a very pleasant manner.

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:13.369
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your
fingers, and put the center of your palm on

01:04:13.369 --> 01:04:23.690
top of the fontanel bone area, and now start
moving it very slowly, very slowly clockwise

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:24.770
the scalp.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:27.380
Press it hard, push back your fingers.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380
Seven times.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:35.420
At this point I must say that I can not force
again the Self-Realization upon you.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.700
I respect your freedom.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.390
You have to ask for it.

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:45.660
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
give me my Realization, give me my Self-Realization”.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.590
Or, “May I have my Self-Realization”.

01:04:47.590 --> 01:05:55.130
(Shri Mataji is blowing in the microphone
7 times.)

01:05:55.130 --> 01:06:01.619
Now please take down your hands.

01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:09.109
Please open your eyes very slowly.

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:11.540
Now watch Me without thinking.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.020
Let’s see if you can do it.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.310
Without thinking.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:20.589
Just watch Me without thinking.

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:27.900
Please put your right hand towards Me, right
hand towards Me like this.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:36.160
And the left hand above your head and bend
your head and try to see if you are feeling

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.180
any cool breeze from here.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.710
Bend your head, bend, bend it.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.980
Little higher.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:57.780
Some people get it very high, very high they
get it, some of them.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.890
Move it.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:06.490
And now put the left hand towards Me like
this, again bend your head and see if you

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:19.849
are getting a cool breeze in your head.

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:28.819
Now put your right hand towards Me again,
bend your head and see for yourself again

01:07:28.819 --> 01:07:36.319
if there’s a cool breeze.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:51.220
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
and push back your head and ask a question

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:57.110
three times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost?

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:59.230
Mother, is this the Brahma Shakti?

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:06.880
Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of
God’s Love?”

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.800
Just ask the question.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.440
Now put down your hands.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.920
Now please put your hands like this.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.480
You’ll feel very relaxed and peaceful.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.440
In the hands also you’ll feel little cool
breeze coming.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:39.339
Some people might feel in one hand, might
feel in another hand.

01:08:39.339 --> 01:08:43.369
Some of them do feel that way.

01:08:43.369 --> 01:09:00.429
All those who are feeling the cool breeze
on top of their heads or on their fingertips,

01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:02.859
please raise both your hands.

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:12.849
Both hands to be raised those who are feeling
it.

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:18.309
Just imagine!

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:21.390
Most of them have felt it.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.609
Imagine.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:25.060
Hardly very few haven’t felt.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:33.579
It’s very easy for them also to feel it
and if they want they can come up to the stage

01:09:33.579 --> 01:09:35.519
and people can look after them.

01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:42.659
They can feel it today, they should and they
will work out their Kundalini.

01:09:42.659 --> 01:09:51.929
Maybe little help is needed and it’s very
kind of you, all of you to have received your

01:09:51.929 --> 01:09:52.929
Realization.

01:09:52.929 --> 01:09:55.360
I bow to all of you.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:02.229
I bow to all of you and I beg of you as a
Mother that please look after your Self-Realization,

01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:04.679
do not waste it.

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:10.939
Those who haven’t got it should not feel
in any way disturbed or upset, it’s very

01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.090
simple.

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:17.590
Maybe the little time was needed more or whatever
it is.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:22.179
I would request them to come on the stage
for five minutes or ten minutes and they might

01:10:22.179 --> 01:10:25.010
get their Realization very well.

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:27.280
May God bless you.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:44.829
Also if you want to come and meet Me you can
come on the stage, I would like to talk to

01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:45.829
you.

01:10:45.829 --> 01:10:46.829
So many!

01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:47.960
Now what do you want?

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.209
The England, the whole England!

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:55.980
Those who want to be should come, one by one,
please.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Mahakali Puja
France

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.910
July 11, 1993

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.720
Today we have decided to have the Puja of
the Devi.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:35.320
This time we are not talking about Adi Shakti,
about Kundalini or about Saraswati, Mahalakshmi.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.510
We are talking about the Mahakali.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:01:02.910
That's the Goddess which is the first one,
which comes first and establishes Shri Ganesha

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.840
in the form of Gauri.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:29.620
She’s the complete form of Mahasaraswati
and Mahalakshmi.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.640
Out of Her only these energies emit.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:52.970
So She’s the one who is the Power of desire
of God.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.890
Within us also She creates desires.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:21.380
These desires within us start emitting outside
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.420
our desires.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.490
The first and foremost desire, as you know
very much, the most primitive, is to feed

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.150
yourself.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:45.160
And this is given to us by the Goddess.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.370
She gives us the desire to feed ourselves.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.510
Now if we don't feed ourselves, then we cannot
survive, we have to have food.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:10.730
It is very important that we should feed ourselves
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:25.910
And also we have seen that when this kind
of desire grows very much more than normal,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:37.910
then you become slaves of this desire and
any amount of food cannot satisfy you.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.310
All the time you think of nothing else but
food.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.570
I have told you many a times that the French
are very particular as to what they should

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.570
eat.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.459
You see, they take at least forty-five minutes
on a dinner table to decide what they will

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.459
eat.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.620
Ultimately, it's just the same.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.461
I mean, I don't understand how can you need
forty-five minutes to decide what you want

00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.620
to eat.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.380
But this desire starts acting through your
ego.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.750
So it satisfies you.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:33.800
And also those people who are manufacturing
food or who are supplying food in hotels and

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.710
all that know how to satisfy your desires.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.900
So they bring it in a way, show it round and
then place it before you, so that you approve

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.330
of it and when you approve of it then they
serve.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:59.810
They know how to befool you and you feel quite
happy, “Oh, it’s very good.”

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.750
Even the wine is given for testing first of
all and, whether you like it or not, you have

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.650
to say, “It's very good,” and you better
show that you like it.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:23.500
So this desire gets completely controlled
by your ego and when it becomes a kind of

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:35.270
a collective desire and a collective ego expression,
then we become like gluttons, you see, I would

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.030
say sophisticated.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.650
They are sophisticated, but we are gluttons.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:49.990
Now with that, other things also people want
to have, like proper sort of a table lying

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.090
and linen, this, that.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:06.940
Of course, if ego is not there, then people
would like to see, to please others by feeding

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.670
them.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.860
This desire reacts.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:23.940
And then the new desire comes in through the
blessings of the Mahakali that you like to

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.199
see others eating the food.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.699
You enjoy when others eat the food cooked
by you, served by you, given by you.

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.010
Just want to watch.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.699
That gives you satisfaction.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:46.240
But food, to any extent you may go, you will
never be satisfied.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.669
Today you’ll ask for this, tomorrow for
that.

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:50.669
This, that.

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.430
Now, in the Western life today, it has become
very important to ask the child every day,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.870
“What will you have?”

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.770
In olden days the food was cooked for all
the family, everybody would eat the same food.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.720
But now you must ask the child, “What will
you have?”

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.260
Then the child has to say, “I'll have this.”

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.130
Now, supposing you don't have that in the
fridge, you are finished.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:19.210
Early in the morning there will be no shop
open, nothing.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:25.090
How will you please that boy in his ego because
he wants a particular thing, so gradually

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.030
we build up even the ego of our children.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.460
We have to say, “This is cooked, this is
nice and you eat this.”

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:44.050
Is the duty of parents not to allow children
to grow their ego by what they want.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.240
You should know what they have to have.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:55.950
Then it starts growing and growing and growing
till they become quite grown up, but very

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.950
primitive.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:07.169
So, actually, the blessings of the Devi on
this point is that She gives you a desire

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:09.660
that you should serve others.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.750
Also you then get concerned about people who
are starving, want to find out why they are

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.970
starving.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:25.110
The another extreme of this could be that
some people think we should not eat so much,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:32.660
a kind of a sacrificing nonsense.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.110
Whatever one has to eat, one should eat.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.269
Then they say, “Why should we eat so much,
Mother?

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.979
After all, there are people who are starving.”

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:47.610
By your eating less or more, you cannot save
those who are starving, can you?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.420
So there’s no wisdom in this kind of austerity.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:01.829
And when the people enter into this kind of
austerity, then they have sufferings and troubles

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:08.139
and such people become extremely, I should
say, ascetic and hot-tempered and you should

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:12.269
never go near a person who is of that kind
without a barge pole.

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:14.860
God knows when he’ll jump on you.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:23.929
So a person who is hungry is as bad as a person
who is overfed.

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:27.290
I think hungry is worse.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:37.839
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire
that comes to you is that everyone should

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.579
love you.

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:50.290
This comes because that makes you good person.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.670
You know that everybody likes goodness.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:10:02.339
So people try to be good to others, nice to
others, say a hundred times, “Thank you,”

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:06.930
do all kinds of things to please others.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.779
By pleasing others, they think others will
like us very much.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:20.170
But then it develops again out of bounds and
then all the time you try to please others

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.139
so that you become absolutely slavish.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:32.759
You become so artificial that people can make
out that it’s nothing natural is this gentleman.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:37.360
He’s just trying to please us.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:47.989
Now, with that, the pleasing behind is some
sort of an advantage out of it.

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:55.420
If you please another one with a detached
mind, not expecting anything that should be

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:02.119
done for you or that could be achieved through
that pleasing, is very pure pleasing and is

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:03.119
very good.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:04.119
That makes you really righteous and good.

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:13.369
But supposing you try to please others only
just to take advantage of that person, then

00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:19.250
you develop hypocrisy – hypocrisy of the
worst type.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.300
And you get lost.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.720
People mock at you, laugh at you.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
They are never pleased.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:33.139
They know that you are a hypocrite and you
are doing it for some sort of an advantage

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.369
or an exploitation.

00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:40.529
You are not doing it because you want to be
good really, to be nice.

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:44.750
A person who is good, automatically pleases
others.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.529
But he doesn’t try to please.

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:56.180
He’s just – his nature is such, his temperament
is such that he just pleases people.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:05.199
This, when taken over again by Mister Ego,
then really you can't beat it.

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:11.959
Such … then they become diplomats, you see,
could be politicians, all these doomed classes

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:15.949
they become and they cannot get out of it.

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:19.739
They get so much used to it, that they cannot
get out of it.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.939
Now what does the Devi do?

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:26.209
She brings the truth before them.

00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:30.100
She shows that what you have been doing for
a particular exploitation doesn’t work out.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.519
Up to a point it does.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.519
She exposes them.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:42.299
The exposure starts and with that exposure,
they are surprised, “How am I exposed?

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:45.649
How am I caught, how people know?”

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:53.050
This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:03.509
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is
falsehood, that is untruth, She exposes.

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:12.589
Then the third desire people have is to possess
material things, from which materialism has

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:13.589
come.

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:17.110
But there’s no end to it.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:24.239
End can never come because they have no satisfaction
in getting one thing.

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:26.809
Supposing today, “ I want to have this carpet.

00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:28.709
All right, I'll get this one.”

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:30.049
Then I want to have another one.

00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:32.199
Then want to have another one.

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:35.860
Then I want to have a car and then I want
to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.990
I don't know what I want to have then.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:44.999
So it goes on and on and on and on until you
reach a time where people start thinking,

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:47.160
“What's the matter with him?”

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.929
And you cannot enjoy anything that you get.

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:57.679
This is also a human failing and this human
failing creates economics, you know that.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:00.110
Economics is created because wants, in general,
are not satiable.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.259
They are not satiable.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:17.529
So what happens, we go on from jumping from
one to another to another to another 

00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:18.529
and another.

00:14:18.529 --> 00:14:25.739
So then you become slaves of entrepreneurs,
so much so, that you lose your individuality

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:26.739
completely.

00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:33.720
For example, an entrepreneur produces a funny
kind of a dress, one, one year.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:42.220
So everybody wants to wear the same, without
thinking, if it is necessary or not.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.920
Then he brings in another form.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.689
Next year everything is given up, buy the
another one.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.649
Third year another one.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:15:00.130
So, pile of all these clothes are there, and
nicely the manufacturer has become a great

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.540
man of designs – he’s very good designs,
how to befool human beings.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:12.209
He has become a rich man and you have become
poor with all these kind of clothes which

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:15.639
has no meaning for you anymore.

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:23.350
About the same thing, about everything, something
is fashionable.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.879
That means you have no individuality.

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:30.589
We talk of individuality, but we want to do
things which everybody is doing.

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:38.669
I mean, you know that all kinds of absurd
things people have done in the name of fashion

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:44.382
and specially people who are not traditionally
bound, who have had no traditions like Americans,

00:15:44.382 --> 00:15:45.382
I would say.

00:15:45.382 --> 00:15:51.669
They go on changing after every six months.

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:57.249
Every year you go, you find a new type of
people there, new type of clothes.

00:15:57.249 --> 00:16:04.779
It's very surprising how they change so fast
without even thinking whether this will suit

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:06.169
me or not.

00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:10.790
Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll
go with tight clothes.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.509
Then they develop varicose veins, so they
wear with the holes.

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:19.809
Then they develop some other problem, then
they wear another kind.

00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:22.850
Nobody wants to think, “Why should I change
my dress?”

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:28.559
Like, say, in India we wear saris, finished.

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.899
Nothing doing.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:33.079
No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:35.359
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy.

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:42.790
And a sari came called as mini sari in India,
which was up to here maybe, I don't know,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.819
not six inches, but at least up to the knee.

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:51.790
It came for about, I think, eight, seven days
in Bombay and went back.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.169
People said, “Get lost.

00:16:54.169 --> 00:16:56.540
We don't want it.”

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:12.520
So this headache of all the time getting into
a fashion like herds without any sense in

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.380
the head has to be understood properly.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.630
Why people do it?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.280
Because they have no brains.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.060
They are brainless people.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.580
They’re not intelligent to see that we are
befooled every year.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.540
But, for Sahaja yogis, the Mahakali power
works and She teaches them that “All right,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.540
this dress suits you.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.060
Have this one.”

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:44.000
And it's the best for you.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.262
Once for all, your lifelong problem is solved.

00:17:46.262 --> 00:17:53.740
With this kind of blouse, I started wearing
from the very beginning perhaps and I've been

00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:00.480
wearing it and now I find everybody wears
the same style.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.490
Why to waste your energy in changing every
day this blouse starting from here to here,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:10.210
to here and going back again like this, you
see.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.110
Is such a waste of energy, such a waste of
cloth.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:19.190
And we make ourselves so cheap running with
this race of reducing the sleeves, reducing

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.700
this, reducing that – or increasing.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:35.510
Is all a desire to impress people that we
are very up-to-date.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.270
Who wants to know?

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:44.320
Who wants to find out that you are up-to-date
or not?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:51.680
And we have no courage to keep to our own
dress that we have purchased.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.650
Why to waste so much money?

00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:00.640
We never even think, go on changing, changing,
changing for nothing at all.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.090
So this is desire is there to impress others
with our outside things.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:18.570
So many things like dress there are, which
we try to impress.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.500
Now, hairstyle: I read an article.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:29.090
They said that these hairstyles are responsible
for many divorces.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:36.130
I was wondering, “How can it be hairstyles
be responsible for divorces?”

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:45.650
Because they had made a survey: a man had
liked a hairstyle of his fiancée and then

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:53.750
she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced
her.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:59.090
And the other way round.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:14.190
When it is so cheap way of disposing of such
a deep relationship of husband and wife.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.480
Now certain fads start.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:24.440
I also saw one documentary about a lady who’d
said that – it was in the one of the advertisements,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:33.720
something, sort of a thing appeared that your
legs should be of this shape and what you

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.010
should do.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.680
So poor thing spent so much time, energy,
ran up and down to make the legs.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.310
I mean what is the importance of these legs,
except for walking?

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.220
So, she went to make the shape like that,
you see.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:50.620
She used to measure it – would be always
something missing here or there.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.510
Then many people joined.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.350
They had a class for it.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.900
And a group joined to make legs like that.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:03.650
And, ultimately, they found out that that
leg was made out of wood.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:13.530
And they spent so much money, so much energy
to make legs like that.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.930
For what?

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.730
What is the purpose?

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.450
If anybody says, “You run like this,”
they start running.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.300
They say, “Jump like this,” they start
jumping.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.620
But why?

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:36.780
Have we gone all nuts in our heads that we
should accept whatever one says, we start

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.150
doing that.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.910
What is the purpose?

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.580
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads
when we start using our ego.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.230
With the ego a person becomes absolutely stupid.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.580
Because he’ll say, “What's wrong?

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:04.150
What's wrong if I have just a little hair
here?

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.730
What's wrong?”

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:20.570
“If I just try to wear a very short dress
here, what's wrong?”

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:26.120
The wrong is, why are you wearing?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.800
Why don't you ask a question?

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.330
Why are you wearing?

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.910
If you ask a question to yourself,” Why
do I have this kind of hairstyle?

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.380
Why do I do like this?”

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:49.500
It is really difficult to tell people to do
right things, but wrong things people take

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.780
to like that.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.900
For example, I told everyone that you put
oil, if not every day, just before bath, lot

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.520
of oil in your head and wash.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.440
Now I find many people getting bald.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.880
But they didn't put the oil.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.510
What can I do about it?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.900
But such a simple thing they won't have.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.760
Such a simple thing they would not believe,
that you need something for your nourishment.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:28.620
But they will do something which is absurd,
nonsensical without even thinking, “What

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.620
is going to harm us?”

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:36.740
Here the Mahakali, what does She do?

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.120
She punishes you.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.300
Your body is punished.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:48.630
If you wear very tight clothes, you develop
problems of your legs.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:54.740
If you wear holey pants, then you get cramps.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.873
Anything you do abnormal, you have to pay
for it.

00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:08.800
First you have to pay for doing it and then
you have to pay for it physically.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:17.250
So many things can be avoided if we just have
a simple life, decide once for all that, “I

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:23.650
will have this kind of dress for this lifetime,”
finished.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:30.580
Every day to change, itself, is a headache.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.790
But that satisfies the ego, not your Self.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.180
So the Mahalakshmi Principle in us raises
higher and higher.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.630
Despite that, we are pulled down.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:25:02.900
Then this Mahakali, She comes forward and
shows what wrong we have done, how we have

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:28.930
gone wrong, how we have missed the point.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:41.830
Instead of think, “What is wrong?”

00:25:41.830 --> 00:26:00.760
She teaches you it is wrong.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:16.900
Then another thing She does, which is a very
beautiful thing She does, I think sometimes,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:23.810
that She creates a illusion to test your intelligence,
to test your sensibility, She creates an illusion,

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.190
Bhranti rupena samstita.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:35.020
She makes a bhranti in your head.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.250
Illusion.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:45.780
So you become illusive or others become illusive
or a situation becomes illusive.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.350
And you are lost in it.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:58.080
Then you really did understand that “It's
wrong thing I have done.”

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.340
It's a very nice story about Narada.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:13.950
Narada was under an impression about himself
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:19.660
he started saying, “Oh, look at me.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.550
I’m never enticed by any woman.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:29.450
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.720
I am never enticed.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.930
I am the highest, of highest, brahmachari.”

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:44.590
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:58.300
So they met him in a forest and told him,
“Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.809
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s
wasted.

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:07.940
You must test your beauty.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:13.740
You must see how beautiful you are.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.070
You are so handsome.”

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.520
He said, “Really?”

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.980
“Yes,” she said.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.370
“There’s a very simple way of testing.”

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.370
“Is how?”

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:30.140
She said, “There’s a wedding coming up
of a very beautiful woman.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:39.930
She is the princess of the beauty … city,
is called Rupadaka – and you should go there

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:47.050
and see how she will appreciate you.”

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:54.990
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he
went there.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:09.380
And he was sitting and lots of people were
coming, big, big maharajas, rajas, all of

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.330
them were sitting and he was thinking, “Oh,
I’m the best among all of them.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.900
Who are these?

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:27.400
The princess will just garland me, no doubt
about it.”

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:41.020
And these two were, you see, putting that
illusion into his head, bhranti.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.970
With the Agnya, you get bhranti.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.960
This princess came round.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.940
She looked at him and she laughed aloud.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:30:00.670
She couldn't control herself and she moved
on giggling.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.900
Couldn't understand why she laughed at him.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:13.380
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she
just laughed.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:20.850
So couldn’t understand, “I’m such a
handsome man,” this thing.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:27.590
So these two gandharvas told him, “Oh, doesn’t
matter.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.320
You see, she doesn’t understand.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.230
She'll come back,” this, that.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:41.010
Then they went out and near a lake and he
sat down to wash his face and looked at in

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.020
the water his reflection.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.170
He, looked like a monkey.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:51.830
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:56.230
He said, “I look like a monkey.”

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:02.540
Said, “To us, you look like very handsome.”

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:12.920
“But I really look like a monkey.”

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.890
So this bhranti, this illusion was created
in his mind by his ego.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:23.980
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,
She puts this ego right by creating illusion,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980
bhranti.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.400
And this is responsible for many illusions
we run after.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:34.150
It’s a mirage, running after it, running
after it.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:40.140
Once we are satisfied within ourselves, then
we don't run after mirages.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:50.890
This illusion, if it is not created, people
would be so egoistical that whole world will

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:51.890
be finished.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.628
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power
within us, that She creates illusions.

00:31:53.628 --> 00:31:54.628
Many people talk of maya.

00:31:54.628 --> 00:31:55.628
“This is, Mother, maya.

00:31:55.628 --> 00:31:56.628
This is maya.

00:31:56.628 --> 00:31:57.628
That is maya.”

00:31:57.628 --> 00:31:58.628
Is the work of Mahakali.

00:31:58.628 --> 00:31:59.628
She wants to test you.

00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:00.628
She wants to test you.

00:32:00.628 --> 00:32:01.628
But in Sahaja Yoga it's not such a strong
one.

00:32:01.628 --> 00:32:02.628
For example, you know Abraham had a son.

00:32:02.628 --> 00:32:03.628
One son He had after a long time.

00:32:03.628 --> 00:32:04.628
And God asked Him that He should sacrifice
his son.

00:32:04.628 --> 00:32:05.628
His wife said, “ I also was feeling terrible
that He has to sacrifice His son.”

00:32:05.628 --> 00:32:06.628
So He went down to the place where the child
was to be sacrificed.

00:32:06.628 --> 00:32:07.628
He made a fire, everything and He was about
to put the child on that pyre of fire when

00:32:07.628 --> 00:32:08.628
the voice came, “This is Mahakali, that
you don’t have to sacrifice your child.”

00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:09.628
We have many such stories in Indian mythology
also where they were tested.

00:32:09.628 --> 00:32:10.628
So to test Sahaja yogis also, this Mahakali
helps you.

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:11.628
There was a gentleman who was very egoistical,
so I told him to come to Delhi because I didn’t

00:32:11.628 --> 00:32:12.628
know how to do it here.

00:32:12.628 --> 00:32:13.628
Came to Delhi and he told everybody, “See,
Mother told me to come here just to cure Her.”

00:32:13.628 --> 00:32:14.628
I said, “All right.

00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:15.628
Come along.”

00:32:15.628 --> 00:32:16.628
He came.

00:32:16.628 --> 00:32:17.628
I said, “What’s wrong with Me?”

00:32:17.628 --> 00:32:18.628
He said, “Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad.”

00:32:18.628 --> 00:32:19.628
I said, “Really?

00:32:19.628 --> 00:32:20.628
You put a bandhan to yourself and now see
for yourself.”

00:32:20.628 --> 00:32:21.628
“Oh my God, what’s happening to me here?”

00:32:21.628 --> 00:32:22.628
I said, “That’s My Nabhi.”

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:23.628
So this is how the illusion corrects you.

00:32:23.628 --> 00:32:24.628
If there is no illusion, you would not ever
be corrected directly.

00:32:24.628 --> 00:32:25.628
Supposing I say, “Don't do this.”

00:32:25.628 --> 00:32:26.628
You may not like.

00:32:26.628 --> 00:32:27.628
Of course, mostly you like, but sometimes
you don't.

00:32:27.628 --> 00:32:28.628
And then the illusion works and then you realize,
“Where was I and where am I now?

00:32:28.628 --> 00:32:29.628
I should not have done this.

00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:30.628
How is it I have landed into this problem?

00:32:30.628 --> 00:32:31.628
What has made me so stupid?”

00:32:31.628 --> 00:32:32.628
So this is something which She does.

00:32:32.628 --> 00:32:35.630
Another is She's the one who relaxes you completely.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:44.990
When you are tired and fed up, when you don't
know what to do, then She makes you sleep.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.460
She’s the one who gives you sleep.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:57.390
All day's work you do, ultimately the Mahakali
power acts on you as sleep.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:03.030
She makes you sleep, sleep like a child.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:10.420
You know, at that time, all that wrong we
have done to ourselves and to others are forgiven.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:21.190
In Her lap we sleep nicely, quietly and all
our problems are solved.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:29.810
In those dreams, when you are, She brings
forth solutions to you.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.870
I know so many people told Me, “Mother,
you came in my dream and told me that this

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.790
is the medicine you should take.”

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:45.100
“You came in my dream and You told me that
this particular type of life will suit you.”

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:51.780
They see Me clearly coming, but there it is
not whole of Me, but I think the Mahakali

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.780
Power acts.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.040
Into very deep sleep you are, it is called,
as the sushupti.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.150
There She appears.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:07.460
One lady came to Me and she said, “Mother,
You came in my dream and you said that “I’m

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.440
here in Bombay.”

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.600
Nobody told me.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.940
So, so many things happen like this.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.349
In the dream She guides you and tells you.

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:28.070
Now what happens sometimes, people tell Me
that I had such and such dream, which is all

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.139
falsehood, I know.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.790
They never dreamt like that.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.440
They never saw like this.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.269
But, just to impress Me, they tell Me that
“Oh, I had a dream,” this, that.

00:34:39.269 --> 00:34:44.690
I just show complete ignorance, “Ya, must
be.”

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.249
Then they are put into again bhranti, means
illusion.

00:34:48.249 --> 00:34:55.549
Gradually, they realize that it was wrong
to tell lies to Mother.

00:34:55.549 --> 00:35:00.039
So the correction part takes place.

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:14.170
But the greatest thing that She does is to
give you the sense of chastity and security.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:22.809
When the children are born, they have sense
of chastity, shame, decency, decorous behavior.

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:29.089
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,
they start misbehaving.

00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:32.290
To them, decency becomes a bondage.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:38.240
But, naturally, She's there to tell you that
“This is indecent.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.739
You shouldn't do it.

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:42.880
This is wrong.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.529
This is not the proper thing to do."

00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:55.359
But gradually, you grow up and mature, then
you go, “What’s wrong?”

00:35:55.359 --> 00:36:09.460
You start disrespecting your chastity and
you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:20.210
All this, if is understood through meditation,
the Mahakali helps you a lot.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:29.369
In meditation, She helps you a lot because
She's the one who creates the proper passage

00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:32.720
for kundalini to rise.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:40.290
Mahakali is the same as the kundalini because
She is the residual energy of Mahakali Power,

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.660
full of it there.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.800
But the function is different.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:54.270
The function of Mahakali is to protect you,
is to guide you, to give you wisdom.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:06.400
And the function of the kundalini is to cleanse
you, to clear it out, not to play about with

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.180
you, to forgive you and help you to grow properly.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:18.059
Now in your life, as Sahaja yogis, you will
see how Mahakali helps you in every way.

00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:26.630
It is so interesting to watch Her work, how
She brings forth all kinds of satisfactions

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.910
to you.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.420
The greed goes away.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.440
The temptations go away.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.769
The temper goes away.

00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.380
All these things disappear.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:43.600
The most helpful thing She does, that you
get rid of your bad habits.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.980
Absolutely.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:53.480
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali's
power, you just do not want anything destructive

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.869
to be practiced.

00:37:55.869 --> 00:38:05.380
If you have been practicing anything destructive,
you try to get rid of it.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380
Just you stop it.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.380
“I don’t want to have it.”

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.819
I never tell you, “Don’t do this.

00:38:09.819 --> 00:38:11.079
Don’t do that.”

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:16.380
It's the Mahakali power within you which is
awakened, does all these things.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.710
And She has made you so beautiful, so angelic.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:28.049
She has, by Her corrections and by Her illusions,
She has made you like this so you don't get

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:46.239
so much attached to money, to greed, to lust,
all these things which are responsible for

00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:48.739
putting you down; also possessiveness for
children, possessiveness for husband, possessiveness

00:38:48.739 --> 00:38:50.609
of matter.

00:38:50.609 --> 00:38:54.930
You just start understanding that the joy
is in sharing.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:03.130
You want to share everything with others and
that sharing starts when this Mahakali Powers

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:19.869
start giving you blessings of joy, of sharing,
of being collective, of being pure.

00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:26.040
These blessings come to you from the Mahakali
Power.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.420
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali
Power.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.609
May God bless you!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:04:21.989
With love 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.490
all kinds of creative action takes place.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:38.370
You see how Raulbai has love for Me and in
this place you all also got new idea of creating

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.260
a beautiful thing.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.250
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.770
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati,
is love.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.020
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.820
It’s even in the deeper sense, you see.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.490
People who have created all the scientific
things are also out of love for the masses,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.940
not for themselves.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.140
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.840
If they make something for themselves it has
to become for universal use, otherwise it

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.469
has no meaning.

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.330
Even if you say atom bomb and all these things
that are created from science, they are also

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.330
very protective.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.200
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.400
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.300
Of course, they are having cold wars, but
that also will gradually stop, when they will

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.409
be fed up.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.680
So, all the activity on the right hand side,
of Saraswati, basically has to end up in love.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.419
Starts with love and ends up in love.

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.460
Whichever does not end up in love coils up
and finishes off.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.039
It just disappears.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:05.279
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love, just finishes off.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.990
The basis has to be love.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:14.390
Otherwise all such matter that we create which
has angularity, which is not fitting into

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.560
the mass media which is not appealing to the
masses.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.310
Of course, it takes time, you have seen that
it takes time - but it does have that tendency

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.599
always to disappear in the thin air as soon
as you find it does not appeal to the masses.

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:41.810
Now this love of, that we talk of, this great
love of God we talk of, we know it for definite

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.520
through vibrations.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:51.150
People do not have vibrations, but still they
can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.150
way.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.500
All the great paintings of the world have
vibrations.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.230
All the great creative works of the world
have vibrations.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:05.029
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained
by time, otherwise all other things are destroyed.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:09.729
There must have been monuments and horrible
statues and horrible things that have been

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.279
created long time back.

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:19.590
But they were all destroyed by nature, and
they could not stand the impact of the Kala

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.500
- that is the destructive power of time.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:33.840
So, all that is sustaining, all that is nurturing,
all that is en-nobling, comes from this sense

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.289
of love, which is within us very much developed,
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:47.510
Ultimately the whole world has to realize
that one has to go to that ultimate love of

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.140
God, otherwise it has no meaning.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.990
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods of appealing to people by

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.820
using cheap things and very vulgar things,
just to make people think that this is art.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.349
But this will all disappear.

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:08.990
It cannot sustain the impact of the time as
I told you, it cannot.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.630
Because the time will kill it.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.669
All these things have to disappear and already
you can see the result, how things are changing

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.260
everywhere, even in the West.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.839
So there is no need to be so much disappointed
with the West and to say that the Western

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.450
world is a wasteland.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.280
It is going to be alright and it has to be
done.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.570
Especially it has done lot of Puja of Saraswati,
I should say, in the West.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:38.669
Much more than they have done in India because
they have gone to learning and they have tried

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.200
to find out so many things.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.490
But only thing they forgot that it is a Goddess,
Goddess of Learning.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.530
Everything comes from the Goddess.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.360
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.170
And that’'s why all the problems have been
created.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.220
If there is no Spirit in your learning, if
there is no source of the Goddess in your

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.940
learning, then it is absolutely useless.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.769
If they had realized that there is the Spirit
that is working it out, they would not have

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:04.910
gone that far.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:12.670
And that’s what I was warning the Indians,
all through, that you are now taking to industrial

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:19.399
revolution in a way and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution, you must try to

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.870
know the Spirit.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.600
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.900
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.760
You will also go the same way.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.950
At random you will run and there will be problems,
the same problems as the Western people have.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.589
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:49.770
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible to tell them even in

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.330
one lecture, even in ten lectures.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:10:00.000
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati, while doing the worship

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.050
of Saraswati, is to be seen very clearly within
ourselves.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:08.720
For example the Western people are very fond
of Surya because they have no Surya.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.150
But they go too far with it, as you know,
and create complications within themselves

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.150
of Surya.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:27.260
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within, is the

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.320
light within.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.570
And if Surya chakra at the Agnya level is
occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is even

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:46.802
more essential that the purity of life, what
we call ‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:52.030
Now morality itself has become very much sort
of an argument in the West.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.260
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.070
On vibrations of course you know.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.350
But they have gone all against it.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:08.690
Those who are worshippers of Jesus, those
who are the worshippers of the Surya, of the

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.110
Saraswati have all gone against it.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.560
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying
it.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:24.990
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not
have a proper sense of morality and holiness.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:31.710
The Surya itself brings light, to see everything
clearly.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.280
So many qualities Surya has got.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.630
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty,
filthy.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:44.900
It dries up all these places, which create
parasites.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.410
But so many parasites are created in the West.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:53.580
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things which have come

00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:02.630
into those countries which are supposed to
be full of light, and in that darkness they

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.630
exist.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:13.170
Darkness about their Spirit, darkness about
their own knowledge and darkness about love.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.530
These three things have taken over in the
places where you are supposed to love light.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.779
Light doesn’t mean, light doesn’t mean
what you see with your gross eyes.

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:28.620
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.620
That one should understand – Light of Love.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:37.480
And it is so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring, it’s

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:44.431
so abounding that unless and until you can
feel that light within you - that light which

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:50.190
is of pure love of purity, pure relationships,
pure understanding.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:13:03.170
If you can develop that kind of a light within
yourself, then the whole thing will be cleansed.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.500
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.380
This is what happens to you when you are completely
cleansed.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.290
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.680
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.480
Our chakras are made out of that purest form
of nature.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:33.550
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking, against the same Saraswati’s

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.550
power.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.550
You are going against Saraswati itself.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:42.040
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.779
all that.

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:49.480
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:57.000
And that’s what one has to understand - that
this pure intelligence, is not to be soiled

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.140
by our thinking.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:10.240
Our thinking can make us so bumptious, so
ego-oriented, so impure, that, we can really

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.300
eat the poison and say 'what is wrong with
it'?

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.970
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:22.000
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us Subuddhi,
wisdom.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.029
And that is why to worship Saraswati, to worship
Surya; we must have that clear vision as to

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.210
what we have to be.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.660
What we are doing.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.839
What filth we are living in.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.020
What our mind is getting into.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.589
After all we are here for emancipation and
not for just for pampering our ego and living

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:42.990
with our filth that is with us.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:51.339
So this light has come within us and we should
try to rise above our own mental filth, which

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:55.300
is being created around us.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:04.130
Apart from that, you have to go higher and
understand that there is, within us, a thing

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.130
called ego.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.610
And this ego is false, absolutely false.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.570
You do not do anything.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:15.810
Actually when you turn your eyes here and
there, when your attention is here and there

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:21.020
it is nothing but your ego that is trying
to overpower you.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:29.210
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood
because there is only one ego and that is

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.660
of God Almighty, Mahatahamkara.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.081
There is no really any ego that exists.

00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:38.081
It is myth.

00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:43.220
It is a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything - you are

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.390
doing this, you are doing that - which you
are not doing; then this nonsensical ego comes

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.960
in and you start working it out, it can project
in every direction.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:00.370
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.830
others, becomes cruel.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.580
When it moves [to the] right side, it becomes
supraconscious.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.850
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:21.740
When it moves left side then it starts talking
- I mean, seeing things - yourself as a big

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:28.190
man, as a big Christ or as a big Devi or something
like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very great personality'

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.190
- that is left sided.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.220
When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous
one.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:39.339
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:44.649
When their ego moves backwards then they become
gurus, they themselves have lots of defects

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:50.510
in themselves and they try to pull people
into those horrible stuff, which is described

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.490
as absolute Naraka.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.649
That’s how, is the movement of ego on all
the sides.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:05.240
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi
that is, to talk about themselves, is the

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.939
worst of all.

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:11.890
Whatever type of ego you may have, if you
start boasting about it and talking about

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:20.069
it, then it encircles, thickens the walls
of ego so much, that it is impossible to penetrate

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:21.069
into that.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:26.929
Because such a person is completely satisfied
with himself and he believes that he is so.

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:31.840
And once he starts believing into a nonsense
like that, it's an impossibility, is an impossibility

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.370
to penetrate.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:43.380
So, when you boast about these things or you
talk big, be careful.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.580
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.640
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations
for you.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.130
But how many times do I say so?

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.580
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.900
But I don't say that.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.960
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may
happen.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.900
The whole thing might be blasted with that.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:09.140
So, one has to understand that Mahatahamkara
is the one that acts, that works, that creates.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.350
Sometimes I shout at you.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.809
Immediately all the bhoots run away.

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:12.809
Just once I shout.

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:17.159
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:18.159
Yesterday just I started.

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:23.610
So you should understand that now you are
a realized souls, you can also do the same.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.370
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting, will

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.490
you stop talking all this nonsense, will you
stop showing off!''

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.390
Then it will stop.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:41.840
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.379
Who want to do something about it, not that
they are not active.

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:45.509
They want to do it.

00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:49.080
But they know only one way, is to act talkative.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:56.650
They don't understand that there are inner
ways by which you control it much more.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:02.270
Because they don't want to take to that, they
take to this talking.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:09.820
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power goes.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:15.399
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:16.399
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything, but if you start

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:22.289
telling others, and talking about it too much,
then the powers that you have got will all

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:23.409
be disappearing gradually.

00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:28.200
And you will just come down to absolutely
lowest level.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.389
So one should not too much talk that “I
have this power, I have this power” or “I

00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:33.730
see this” or “I do this,” which is a
very wrong thing.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.460
I warn you, don’t try to show off.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.730
Yes, you can talk about My powers.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.749
It is all right.

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:45.690
But don't try to talk about your powers.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.830
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.170
then you should say that “we”, not “I”.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.149
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within us.

00:19:58.149 --> 00:19:59.149
We have seen people”.

00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:02.370
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.840
What you have to say is 'We'.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.809
Then you become the Mahatahamkara.

00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:10.669
When you say 'We', Yes some of us', 'we do'.

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:17.429
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it, I
saw to it, that he should not have many 'I's',

00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:19.480
but he should have 'We'.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.520
'We think', 'we do', 'we'.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.909
Means, the whole collective being, the whole
collective organism, living organism of Sahaja

00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:28.909
Yogis.

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:32.649
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',
that means, you put yourself down, but put

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.080
all others above you.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.580
Say: 'Yes, some of us have.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.080
I know some people have this.'

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.629
That’'s the way one should do it.

00:20:38.629 --> 00:20:45.470
Because if you have to overpower your ego,
you must allow it to spread into everybody

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.470
else.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.559
That’s how you will make it perfectly all
right.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.559
Let it spread.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:50.559
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.529
But that pride is not there.

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:55.200
I've seen that pride is not there.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.720
Still it is very individualistic.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.809
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens, that you become one personality,

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:04.809
one organization.

00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:07.880
But the person will look down upon other people.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.529
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:17.619
But he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis,
how beautiful we are.

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:21.350
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful
we are.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:33.169
So always think in the words of 'we', so your
ego will become much less, much less, much

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:34.169
less.

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:42.820
And the same ego, which looked so funny and
absurd, will form tomorrow, the Ekadesha.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.269
Today’s, individual ego will merge into
Ekadesha.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:54.509
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

00:21:54.509 --> 00:22:00.570
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change, because the sun has changed

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.489
its mood, now.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.059
Sun is coming this side.

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:09.429
So let us welcome the Sun, coming to the North
now, this way.

00:22:09.429 --> 00:22:16.299
And for Australians to say that though the
sun has gone, let us establish the Sun, the

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:18.669
domain of Sun, within ourselves.

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:21.740
Because Sun never disappears from our inside.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.340
So that is how we have to take a mood by which
we should think of one personality, all of

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.100
us together, all of us together.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:35.789
And anybody who tries to be something separate
or different, he will drop out.

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:37.850
I will drop him out.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.669
Whatever it may be, it will drop out.

00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:44.370
So you just don’t worry yourself, anybody
who tries to be singled out or anything.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:50.120
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture
the whole, to help the whole, to emancipate

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120
the whole.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.440
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.470
Always.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.809
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga
is.

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:01.549
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:06.809
And the one who has developed this permeating
spirit, is a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:08.480
Who has not, is not!

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.940
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.789
But this permeating personality, which moves
from places to places, whether, you talk or

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:19.789
not.

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:20.789
Like your Mother is.

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:25.289
Whether I meet you or not, makes no difference,
but I am permeating through all of you, by

00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:28.369
little, little things, also, I am there with
you.

00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:32.249
So like that, try to permeate into each other
and see the beauty.

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:36.369
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:39.690
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:45.830
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:52.480
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:59.520
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.320
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.980
And one day I had written in childhood, a
poem, I remember.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.520
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
where it is now - but which said that I want

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.049
to be like a dust particle which moves with
the wind.

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.739
It goes everywhere.

00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:24.419
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:30.899
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:34.379
But I want to be a particle of dust.

00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:39.359
That is fragrant, that is nourishing, that
is enlightening.

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:44.850
Like that, I had written a very beautiful
poem, I must have been about seven years of

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.870
age, I remember - 'To be a dust particle',
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.570
that I should be a dust particle.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.289
So that I’ll permeate into people.

00:24:57.289 --> 00:25:01.590
Which is a very big thing - to become a dust
particle of that kind.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.350
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes
{sounds like ‘enwavened’ but I don’t

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:11.730
think that’s a word – “enlightened”??},
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.799
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:18.570
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:25.220
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming
a dust particle and today just while talking

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.879
to you, I remembered that I wanted to be that,
and that is what this place is.

00:25:30.879 --> 00:25:32.330
And Raulbai is like that.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:38.899
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,
and she lives like a very simple person but

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:41.139
she has a sense of permeation.

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:45.889
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday
who came.

00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:48.200
I am sure that they will take up, Sahaja Yoga,
very well.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:55.460
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia
now, and I am sure there are going to be more

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.460
people.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.059
I hope you have met all of them.

00:25:58.059 --> 00:25:59.059
Make friends with all of them.

00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:00.659
Try to know them who they are.

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:03.470
They may not know English - so get somebody
to translate.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.289
Talk to them and be nice to them, be friendly
with them.

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:09.220
I wanted you to meet them for permeation.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.100
You should know who are the people here, who
are in Nasik.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.679
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis,
you see, who are in that particular place,

00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:19.840
and when we go back we have only one or two
addresses.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.389
It is not a good idea.

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:23.350
Try to see how many people there are.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.029
Ask questions about them, and all that.

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:32.789
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around, and this

00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:38.649
is the way to overcome the problems of the
right side and that is how to worship Saraswati.

00:26:38.649 --> 00:26:45.409
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:48.879
which She plays like music, and the smusic
penetrates into the heart.

00:26:48.879 --> 00:26:51.519
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:59.369
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja
Yogi should permeate - like music into other

00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:00.369
people.

00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:04.059
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:13.070
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.720
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:25.739
Music will end up into melodies, like that
whatever She creates ends up into something

00:27:25.739 --> 00:27:26.739
greater.

00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:30.259
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up into
aesthetics.

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:33.240
If matter does not have aesthetics then it
is gross.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.490
Like that everything.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.379
Now you will say what is water.

00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:38.561
Water becomes the river Ganges.

00:27:38.561 --> 00:27:43.029
These are the subtler things.

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:49.139
So the matter gets into subtler thing because
it has to permeate, it has to permeate.

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:51.490
So everything whatever it is.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:55.419
And the best of all is the air.

00:27:55.419 --> 00:28:01.479
That air becomes the vibrations.

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:17.289
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from 

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:29.820
this matter, from these five elements, becomes
that subtle thing.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:29:07.849
Of course, the left and right side both work
it out because the love has to work on this

00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:53.619
and when love acts on matter it becomes that,
and 

00:29:53.619 --> 00:39:26.539
that is how one has 

00:39:26.539 --> 00:47:14.269
to look at your own lives, to make it 

00:47:14.269 --> 00:49:12.410
a beautiful combination of 

00:49:12.410 --> 00:55:39.569
love and matter.

00:55:39.569 --> 00:56:43.329
May 

00:56:43.329 --> 02:23:40.790
God bless you!

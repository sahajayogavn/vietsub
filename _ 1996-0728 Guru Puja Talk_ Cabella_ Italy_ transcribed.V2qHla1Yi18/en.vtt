00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.940
Today we have gathered here to do Guru puja.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.759
This system started long time back in India,
I think even at the time of Patanjali, maybe

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.290
even earlier, when there were great seekers.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:40.220
And their gurus were sitting in the jungles,
where they used to get permission to go there

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.210
and then they would get their realisation,
very few of them, one or two.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.850
So we had many rishis and munis in the olden
times in India.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
So this system of guru started.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.870
Also one of the reasons is that, that there
is no organised religion in India.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.720
There’s no popes, there are no priests,
nothing like them.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.970
They have priests just for worshipping in
the temples.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:29.310
But for giving realisation, for talking about
higher life, they all had to go to very great

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.260
realised souls.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.409
And it was absolutely the freedom of the guru,
whom to accept whom not to accept.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:50.310
And everybody was tested thoroughly by the
guru if they are capable of achieving Self-realisation

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.409
or not.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:04.219
And this test was so hard, so difficult, and
also to a point of cruelty, that very few

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.299
could pass through that test.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.140
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.920
That, of course, made it a very narrow margin
for people to achieve their realisation and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.890
these gurus never used to leave their own
seats, they call it takiya (meaning: pillow).

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.760
They would be there in their own place, all
those who would like to go to him could come.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.492
If he allowed, then only they can meet him.

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:48.140
You may go on for miles together, nothing,
no obligations of the guru that he should

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.590
meet you.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:04.250
Perhaps they didn’t feel that love and compassion
for the seekers.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.590
They didn’t understand that the seekers
are ardently seeking the truth and they should

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.670
not suffer.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.280
That may be the reason they were not so much
concerned.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.370
All the time they were testing their disciple.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.080
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.760
though he was a born realised.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.371
So to get this Gurupada, to the position of
a guru, after that they had to work very,

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:52.280
very hard to achieve a state of a saint.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.990
But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case, as
you know.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:07.770
I just thought – if people get their realisation,
they’ll see for themselves what’s wrong

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.490
with them, they will introspect themselves
and will try to correct themselves.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:22.690
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind and are

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.919
going on and on and on thinking that they
are Sahaja Yogis, they have achieved a lot,

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.759
they are something very special.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.789
So this delusion is all the time is creating
this problem.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:49.280
This delusion makes them very narrow minded,
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.490
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.259
So the first and foremost thing we have to
know that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:11.930
because Paramchaitanya is transmitting compassion,
It never did before, It never had that kind

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.440
of an attitude which it is there because I
am a Mother.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.770
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realisation, you

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.009
have achieved a state which we can call as
a Self-realised souls.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:41.039
But still, because you got it so easily, cheaply,
I think still we don’t realise what we have

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.050
got.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:53.889
Still we do not practice meditation, introspection
and dedication.

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:03.020
Some are very much there, but mostly we are
just living in the idea that we have already

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.030
achieved.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:19.460
So, the first thing we should introspect:
Are we concerned about ourselves?

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:27.639
All the time do we think that we are suffering,
we have this problem, that problem, or this

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.090
should be done, that should be done.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:41.039
If the attention is on that, that all the
time you are worried about yourself, then

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:49.219
you cannot break, you cannot break through
this shell of your being, which is under the

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:57.860
domination of your mental selfishness or self-centredness.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.350
Even self-centredness is absolutely against
your growth.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:09.129
There are many people who come, I have seen,
even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:16.840
a lot because they think it’s a very open
space where they have to live and they must

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.150
make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.259
Such people have to grow still much more.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:27.389
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.539
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.169
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.099
I have no demands of any kind.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:47.800
But if you are worried about your body comforts
or your body troubles then still you are at

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.460
a body level, which you have to transcend.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:08:03.840
Worried about how you look, how you dress
up, what sort of things you have to wear:

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:13.969
all this makes you yet not a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:21.129
This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still
want very great comforts.

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:31.889
So, what you have to do, if you are used to
comforts: try to go and sleep on the street.

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:34.630
I will not do that, but you can do it.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:44.150
Or sleep on a tree, you may fall down doesn’t
matter (laughter).

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:52.500
Do all kinds of things that are necessary
to punish your body to understand that you

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.480
are not bound with this comfort of the body.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.790
This is one of the greatest things one has
to see, that you are not bound by your body.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:12.100
It’s alright if you have comfort, well and
good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:19.590
For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important that
he should be able to live like a saint.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:29.460
Not necessarily that you should become a sanyasi,
but from inside your body should be such that

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.820
you can dominate your body.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.490
How can you not sleep anywhere?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.460
Why can you not sleep anywhere?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:54.950
Then also, that they want to have a very comfortable
arrangements about bathrooms, this, that.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.240
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious but not superconsciousness,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.260
it’s not there.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.750
You want to have everything first class, and
anybody who tries to interfere with that kind

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.320
of a thing, you don’t like it.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.030
I can understand a person who is very old
– he cannot manage things, he has to have

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:32.770
a certain amount of body comfort, but even
young people these days are extremely comfort-oriented.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.600
That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.240
Of course I’ve seen people in the West are
better off in this matter.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.980
Because when they go to India they told Me
they like [Maharashtra] S.T.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.920
buses better than comfortable buses.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.010
So I said “Why?”

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.399
“Because Mother, you can jump in the bus
nicely with all the luggage,” (due to lack

00:10:55.399 --> 00:11:01.370
of suspension and bumps in road) “Because
the windows are open, you can breathe.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.310
Very natural, very good“.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.400
And they wanted to go on bullock carts also.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.800
I mean they enjoy all that.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.330
Actually if you see you’ll notice, in the
Western World mostly, people are taking to

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.540
a more rustic life.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:23.460
They are enjoying more the rustic style of
life than to this so-called comfortable, artificial

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.460
life.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.640
Not so much Indians, I would say, also Malaysians.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:38.610
I think most of the people I have met in the
Western countries are really great because

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.520
they can sleep anywhere, they can eat anything.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.590
You ask them “How did you like the food?”

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.459
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.120
That is the sign.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:12:00.450
That is the sign of a person who is not bothered
as to what he is eating, what he’s getting,

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:09.170
what is his taste, “I like this, I like
that,” these words drop out.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:16.500
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,
you might think that I am asking you to something,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.850
hazardous thing, you see.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:24.220
It’s not difficult at all, because if you
have to impress the people around you, you

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.820
have to be like a saint.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:35.830
And if you are a fussy person, if you are
a fusspot, then you cannot impress others

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.610
that you have got Self-realisation.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.649
Many people tell Me “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas, do this,

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:48.160
do that, and then they got their realisation.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.040
How is it these people you have blessed?”

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.970
Even some great saints asked Me that.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.530
“What right they had to get their realisation?

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.430
Why did you give them realisation?

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.250
What have they achieved?”

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.930
I said “Only their desire.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:09.060
Their desire was very much there that they
should get their Self-realisation and that’s

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.670
how they got it“.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:20.160
But now to go into only desire, is not sufficient.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.400
You have to depend on yourself, on the light
of your Spirit you should see what’s wrong

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400
with you.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.250
This is a very important thing.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.640
Ask questions to yourself.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.800
“Why do I want this?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.420
Why do I need this?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.210
What is the purpose?”

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.240
Because as you have seen, all the rest of
the world is mad, [we] call it mad, because

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:54.860
they are running after stupid things, they
are wanting things which has no meaning to

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.800
spirituality.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.720
So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.320
If you are spiritually endowed, then you are
self-satisfied.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:14.380
And this self-satisfaction within you will
lead you to that Ocean of Joy about which

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.240
I have been telling you and all the scriptures
have described.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:27.670
For Sahaja Yogis, the word we use is nirananda.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:37.020
Nirananda means: A joyous state, where nothing
is needed.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.800
Joy itself is joy.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.500
You are enjoying only joy.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.450
Nothing is needed to make you happy.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:53.620
You are happy because of joy that you have,
in the nirananda state.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:00.300
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.730
How they managed their life, you’ll be very
much amazed.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.640
How many days they used to fast, without food.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640
Never bothered!

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.290
They never thought it was fasting.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.620
They just used to think, “We have no food,
so no, don’t eat.”

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.920
Of course, you don’t have to go through
[that], you have got your realisation.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.590
So now you have a power to achieve this mastery.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.240
Now, you have this power.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:38.930
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some of them have grudges about others.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:54.370
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:09.400
There is no place for any kind of hatred,
or any kind of revenge, or anger among Sahaja

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.810
Yogis.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.990
If you have that, you must conquer it.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:23.240
Is a good chance, if you find somebody who
is very hot-tempered, who is a very angry

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.530
type, go and make friends with that person.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.480
Just see if you can carry on with that person
or not.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:43.020
If there’s a fusspot, also make friends
with such a fusspot, and see that you achieve

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:50.540
that peace which will keep you above all kinds
of hatred, all kinds of temper, which is a

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.710
very bad thing.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.910
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper very
fast.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:05.060
I would say that they cannot be Sahaja Yogis,
because if you have no control over your anger,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.860
then how are you powerful of compassion and
love?

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.629
But you don’t even have to control it – just
there.

00:17:15.629 --> 00:17:21.230
Once you have it, or that state, then you
just watch and see.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:29.090
In the olden days, the saints ,mostly, used
to be very much angry type people.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:35.620
They couldn’t bear the stupidity of the
world and they used to be very, very angry

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.600
type and they used to run away from people.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:47.480
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who always
lived on the tree, and anybody tried to come

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.779
near him, he used to throw stones at.

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:57.610
Couldn’t bear the people who were all heated
up and coming to him.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:05.749
But you don’t need that, you have a way
of achieving love and affection of the people

00:18:05.749 --> 00:18:13.360
who seem to be very, very troublesome and
grudging type or maybe some people who are

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.390
very aggressive.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:21.170
This is not a difficult task if you try a
little bit the other way round.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.970
Mostly people, when they find somebody who
is a very hot-tempered person, they run away

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.970
from them.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.650
They don’t want to have anything to do [with
them].

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:40.510
Those who are not hot-tempered, those who
are good nature, you can always be friendly,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.820
what is so great about it?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.960
What is so nice about it?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:56.230
What is so sweet about it?

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:04.669
But how you speak to the person, how you talk
to that person, how you manage that person:

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:11.461
your love will definitely melt him down, because
he’s a Sahaja Yogi, I’m not saying for

00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:12.659
non-sahaja yogis.

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:27.960
Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:36.549
Another thing which is extremely important
for us to know, that we have got this realisation

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:39.289
through Mother’s love.

00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:44.850
Only My compassion has acted, only the power
of Mother’s compassion could have worked

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.740
it out.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:56.980
Now, even if this love is flowing towards
the stones, or towards the mountains or towards

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:04.929
anything which is very solid, the ripples
come back, they have to come back.

00:20:04.929 --> 00:20:11.249
In the same way, you people now, who have
got realisation, have to know that compassion

00:20:11.249 --> 00:20:17.590
and love is the only power you have got, nothing
else.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:27.090
If you love yourself, if you care for yourself,
you care for your family and care for your

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.320
children – then you haven’t achieved much.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:40.080
You’re only worried about yourself, because
that’s your limited area where you move.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:53.649
But if you can break that and find out places
where you have to express your love, you can.

00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:57.960
As they say, the water finds it’s own level.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:05.850
In the same way, this compassion has to flow
to all the places, to all the ditches everywhere,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.159
and should find its own level.

00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:19.350
But if you are just satisfied with yourself
and you are not bothered, you are just trying

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:26.940
to believe that you are a great soul because,
you are a Sahaja Yogi, then I must say, that

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.460
you are sadly mistaken.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.700
In this lifetime, you can achieve that state.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:42.110
In this lifetime, you can get to that state
within yourself.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:50.279
Now, the third thing that troubles Sahaja
Yogis is that, “Mother we want God’s realisation,”

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.620
that makes Me laugh.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:58.929
You see, it is already there, already there.

00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:03.590
Like once you get into the sea and you say
“Mother, we want to go to the bottom of

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.950
the sea,” you can always go, just slip,
and you will be there.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:17.740
In the same way, once you have developed a
kind of a Self-realisation and have jumped

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:24.529
into the ocean of this compassion, there’s
no need to achieve anything.

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:31.269
The sense of achievement, “I should be that,
I should be this,” is all coming from your

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:32.350
human haunting.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.530
That should be over.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.960
Now you are Godly people.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.679
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:47.769
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads and

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:49.169
it will work out.

00:22:49.169 --> 00:23:00.690
This is what I have been saying to you that:
you have to dissolve yourself into the compassion.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:09.110
Also, there are still very people who want
to be in the front.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.581
Specially Indians will all sit together in
front, I’ve seen that way.

00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:20.740
They have no right, they have no right to
sit in front.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:27.100
Nobody has right to sit in front or to seek
a place.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:33.730
They should sit wherever they get seat to
sit down with complete satisfaction.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:42.309
Whether you sit in front or at that corner,
even in the darkness, you can get My vibrations,

00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:45.690
you can get everything.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:52.289
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary.

00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:58.879
What is it in a prominence, what do you get?

00:23:58.879 --> 00:24:08.119
To be lost into the crowds, to be lost into
the Ocean of Love is the main thing.

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:15.230
All these are mythical that, we should somehow
or other get the front place.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:27.739
You see as Marathi apan manto (We say), “Samor
chi zaaga patkauli mi!” means “I have

00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:31.110
managed to get the front seat!”

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:38.299
Front will be the back, and back will be the
front.

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:49.230
It is very surprising how still people are
trying to achieve something so nonsensical.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.809
So where is your mind, where is your attention,
what are you thinking?

00:24:54.809 --> 00:25:02.590
If you are thoughtless you will be satisfied,
you will be happy, you will not ask for anything,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.520
you’ll not want anything.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.100
What is there to have?

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.639
What is so important?

00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:16.429
All these ideas come from ignorance, I must
tell you, from ignorance.

00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:20.739
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me.

00:25:20.739 --> 00:25:27.249
And he said that “We have heard you are
a great saint, this thing, that thing, and

00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:33.940
you have all the comforts of life – you
have everything here, very nice, this thing,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.940
that.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.580
So, how are you a saint?”

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.029
I said “How are you a saint?”

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:47.129
[He said] “I have given up my family, I
have given up my cars, I have given up my

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:52.669
house, I have given up my children.”

00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:58.249
I said “One more thing you have given up”,
he said “What?”

00:25:58.249 --> 00:26:01.279
I said “Your brains!!”

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:09.990
(laughter and applause) So he said, “How
do you say we have given up our brains?”

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:16.639
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up nothing,
because I am holding nothing!

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:19.899
What is there to give up when you are not
holding anything?

00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:28.119
Now, I would say in this house, or on my body,
anywhere, [if] you think you can find anything

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:38.080
equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna,
you can take it.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.960
Should be equal though.”

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.190
Now they started looking here and there.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.749
I said “Then what have you given up?

00:26:45.749 --> 00:26:46.749
Just stones?

00:26:46.749 --> 00:26:48.320
What have you given?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.149
Why are you boasting about giving up that,
and giving up this and giving up…?”

00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:58.279
They even shaved their head.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:04.529
All these useless ideas, that “We have done
this, we have done that.”

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:09.210
Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks he is doing
a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga, should give

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.850
up completely!

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.429
That’s the sign of another ignorance.

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:24.070
If you are part and parcel of the Ocean, everything
is done by Ocean, you are doing nothing.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:32.330
To have such ideas about yourself shows how
little you know about your Self.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.809
You are the Ocean.

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:38.769
And if you are the Ocean how can you claim
“I’ve touched this shore, I have touched

00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:41.929
that shore, I have touched this shore“?

00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:44.840
No more “I” is left.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:54.679
Once this I-ness drops out then only the Universal
Being within you shines.

00:27:54.679 --> 00:28:05.549
All these things are so clearly evident in
our characters.

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:15.820
Some people are very identified, say with
their country, or maybe with their worshipping

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.330
style, whatever it is.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.370
All these mis-identifications have to be given
up.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:27.789
It is very difficult for people because they
are so conditioned, and as long as you have

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:36.399
conditioning you cannot rise above your mind,
which is a myth, you cannot.

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:46.379
Now, try to understand, what your conditionings
are.

00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:52.619
One of them, I would say, I have seen and
I am so surprised, you go to the Western countries,

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:57.860
all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.850
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.570
Shri Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:08.780
And now I have seen that vibrations stop!

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.780
Why should they stop?

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.799
Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations?

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:19.149
Why they are doing it, I realised, was because
I said Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:28.559
Their identification is with Christ and Christianity,
in a very subtle way.

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.139
So all the vibrations stopped!

00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:38.980
Imagine with Shri Ganesha’s music, we heard
in one of the Eastern Block countries, and

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:44.710
all the vibrations had stopped and they were
singing all the songs of Shri Ganesha and

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:53.900
not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone about
the Guru, not once.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:01.960
So, even there is a very subtle identification.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:12.140
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed to
be very intelligent, he said that “Alright,

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:18.629
if we keep Mother’s photograph and also
the icons, we can get the same type of vibrations.”

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:26.109
You cannot, because icons are made by some
artist’s imaginary.

00:30:26.109 --> 00:30:34.399
These are not representing actually even Maria
or Christ or anyone, they are all imaginary.

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:43.169
If Italian ones make Christ, he is Italian
style, if some French one makes it, he is

00:30:43.169 --> 00:30:51.580
thin like French, if you get somebody say
from Holland, he will have a forehead like

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.620
that.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:31:01.999
You see all of them they depict Christ as
they want to.

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:10.779
Then we have Maria the same way, Her expression,
her photograph, everything, is all according

00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:18.870
to the imagination of the artist and to whatever
country he belongs, that he will do.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:24.860
And they are not free, you can see they are
not free, because all these artists have a

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.029
certain style.

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:32.129
Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s a style, if
it is, say Leonardo, it’s a style.

00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:38.409
Though they are born realised, still they
have a style.

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:44.909
Nobody is like this, that he’ll make today
like this, tomorrow like that: there’s no

00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:45.909
freedom.

00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:49.970
They are bound by their own styles.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.559
Everybody has one style, and that is the style
they follow.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:32:02.259
Because, what is the reason, the reason is,
they must have done 3 or 4 types of styles,

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:10.130
they must have done, surely, but people must
have rejected, “This is no good, this is

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.389
no good,” so it is all the opinion of the
people.

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:17.789
So they must have taken to one style: alright
this is the style.

00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:26.270
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes, if he’s Chinese,

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:34.520
he’ll have no nose, if it’s Indian, he’ll
be dark.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:42.039
So all kinds of Christs I have seen and I
feel that, how can they emit vibrations?

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.909
Tell me.

00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:48.600
While with my photograph, how can you compare?

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.169
Also, cameras were to be developed at this
time: do you notice that point?

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:59.700
Cameras were developed at this time, not before
that.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.330
This loudspeaker was not developed before
this.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.039
Aeroplanes were not developed before.

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:14.809
I have been travelling for 19 days, one day
in the plane, second day in the public programme.

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:17.489
They could not do all that.

00:33:17.489 --> 00:33:20.450
Nobody could do this.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.590
Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:28.609
They could not fly by aeroplane in those days.

00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:34.029
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries” or go

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:35.029
on correcting.

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:37.179
But is only possible because today, today:
there are aeroplanes.

00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:43.580
They were never there [before].

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:51.710
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there, was

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.159
that available before?

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:56.309
No.

00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:05.390
So this is a very special time, where science
has also supported seekers to find the Truth

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.390
– science has supported.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:14.890
We have to be thankful to science: that part
of science which has been so much supportive.

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:18.470
Even [if] there was not a car, I could not
have gone up to Milan even!

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:26.929
Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would
have happened to Me?

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:32.609
So all these things are created today for
you.

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:38.980
You were also born in those times for the
special reason.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:46.409
They could not give realisation because that
time you were not there.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.859
Very few people of your calibre were there.

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:52.230
But I wonder if you understand your calibre.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:35:01.730
The way you are sometimes growing, shows that
you don’t understand your calibre.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:11.960
You don’t know what you are, how much the
whole atmosphere has worked out for you, the

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.819
science has been worked out for you.

00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:17.150
Science is a gift of the nature.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:27.380
All this has been worked out for you to achieve
the highest state in the shortest time.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:35.799
But for that, one has to be extremely introspecting.

00:35:35.799 --> 00:35:43.289
Instead of thinking of what you have to achieve:
be introspective!

00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:50.670
This introspection will help you and you will
really become real gurus.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:36:00.549
When you go to other villages, other places,
other cities, people should know from your

00:36:00.549 --> 00:36:04.700
being itself that some great person has come.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:14.860
You don’t have to tell, you don’t have
to certify, it’s the simplicity of your

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.700
temperament itself.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.309
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew
about Me.

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:29.210
No advertisements, nothing, They just put
some posters, some.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:35.160
And there were 2,000 people in the hall, 2,000
outside.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.890
In the hall they had to pay, alright.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.520
I was wondering what’s the matter.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:46.799
And when I came out I gave them realisation
but I said “You come tomorrow“.

00:36:46.799 --> 00:36:53.440
So 2,000 from inside and 2,000 from outside
and about 2,000 more came, and we were all

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.750
sitting on the ground.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.180
I was amazed.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.500
I said “What made you come to my programme?”

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:08.550
[They] said “Mother, it’s so obvious,
your photograph!”

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:14.200
Such sensitivity of spirituality: “So obvious,
from your photograph!”

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:21.560
And they were scientists, they were doctors,
they were all kinds of intelligent people.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.799
But they could feel the spirituality from
the face.

00:37:28.799 --> 00:37:31.930
That kind of a sensitivity we should have.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:37.590
When you don’t need any discretion, nothing,
you know: this is this, this is this, this

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.770
is this.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:44.670
Don’t have to judge, don’t have to think
about it.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:55.440
You cannot say who will be best fitted for
this: those who have come for the first time,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:06.020
those who have come later on or those who
will be coming, younger or older, women, men

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.270
or children.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.140
It is there.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.810
In my lifetime if I see so many of you, so
much transformed, looking so beautiful, so

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.920
nice, creating such a good atmosphere.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.210
It’s more than satisfaction for Me.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.829
And sometimes I think there is nothing to
be done now anymore – finished.

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:35.309
But then they invite Me here, and invite Me
there, so I’m just doing.

00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:36.640
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.270
Now, once you have planted the tree…it’s
like a mango tree.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:49.660
Once you have planted a mango tree and looked
after it for 3 or 4 years, then it looks after

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.660
itself.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:58.010
It gives fruits, it doesn’t need any water,
nothing, it just grows by itself.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.670
In the same way it should happen with you.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:05.760
You should grow by yourself.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:14.220
Of course, you will find people who are stupid,
who are aggressive, who are not at all Sahaja

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.560
Yogis and trying to be Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.730
You’ll find all kinds.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.480
So just see them, that’s all.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:34.980
In this Guru puja, you have to decide that
what are the criteria.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:50.260
First a Guru has to be without desires, any
desires whatsoever: nirichcha as they say.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:57.599
There is one false guru in India who said
that ” If I had the powers as Mother has,

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:02.680
then I would have become the king of this
world“.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.260
So people said “Then why don’t you become?”

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.559
Why doesn’t Mother become like that?

00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:10.960
Why doesn’t She become the king?”

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.900
So they said “Because She is nirichcha-
means She has no desires.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.630
A person who has no desires will not become
anything.”

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:23.810
So, I said go and tell him “If you have
desires, you cannot have powers also.”

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:33.000
It’s only because you have no desires, that’s
why all these powers are there.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.680
So any desire that comes in your mind, you
should say “Forget it, just forget it.”

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:51.940
When the desire is overpowering, you just
divert your attention.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:41:02.809
Any kind of stupid desire can take charge
and how do you become desireless is by getting

00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:05.930
to the thoughtless awareness.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:11.910
Any crisis comes in, you should be able to
rise into that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:15.119
Just be peaceful.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:16.250
Look at your desires with peace.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:25.119
You can tell the desire, “Oh, I’m very
much satisfied, now don’t come, I don’t

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.119
want.”

00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:29.440
That’s how you can become desireless.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:42.440
There is this compassion, and the compassion
that becomes actually the power.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:51.359
[With] small, small things you can express
your love, very small, small things.

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:58.109
In very sweet ways, you can express your love..

00:41:58.109 --> 00:42:00.160
Is very important.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.600
The whole world needs today love and peace.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:11.240
And you have to give peace and love to everyone
that is possible.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.460
Of course [with] Sahaja Yogis it is very easy,
but even non Sahaja Yogis, you must treat

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:24.849
them with respect and love, but you should
not have a desire that you should get back

00:42:24.849 --> 00:42:26.520
anything from them.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.890
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.710
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga have gained so much and have

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:41.089
betrayed us – it doesn’t matter, it’s
not important.

00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:45.770
Because they are going to be losers, not we.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:52.160
So, there’s nothing to bother about these
things.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.180
Then another thing is: try to see that your
mind doesn’t react.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:04.480
Some people have a habit, or I think most
of them have, to react.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.200
You tell them something and they’ll put
their own one tail with it, something.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.930
Never will they accept if somebody says something.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.170
If you are reacting, what will go into your
heads?

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.430
What will go into your heart?

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.770
What will go into your attention?

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:33.700
So the reaction itself is a sign of not proper
development within yourself.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:40.630
This attention which is trying to go into
all the areas of your mind and your body and

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.279
everywhere, is not there.

00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:52.780
It cannot enter, because as soon as it tries
to enter, you shut it by reacting.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.860
You cannot see anything just for seeing sake,
you must react.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.000
You say “This is not good, that’s not
good.”

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.270
If I say “It is 5 o’clock” you’ll
say “No!

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:11.279
It is 5 past, 2 minutes, 3 seconds!”

00:44:11.279 --> 00:44:17.050
This comes with terrible conditioning which
has to go away.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.010
Not to react.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.590
Why should you react?

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:30.020
Then the argument starts, then fight starts,
then wars come in.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:35.860
If you tell your mind, “Nothing doing, you
are a myth and I am not going to react to

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.210
anything!”

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.550
99.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:48.490
9% problems will be solved.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:53.530
Then the last, but not the least is the ego.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:45:02.760
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,
just can’t understand.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:09.340
It’s so stupid to have ego.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:17.799
It’s a kind of a domination, if slightest
things are wrong, you get angry.

00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:21.950
If somebody says something, you get angry.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:28.770
That means your power of love and compassion
is still not full.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:38.220
You can of course correct people when they
have to be corrected but for that you should

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.960
have this power within yourself.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:48.020
The person should know that you are correcting
that person because you love that person,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.039
not for selfishness, not for any gain.

00:45:51.039 --> 00:46:02.569
But this ego is a very big problem and that
comes up by, I should say, not only ignorance

00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:09.400
but stupid ideas about yourself.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:17.770
If you think you are something great, already,
then what can you do?

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:23.260
Ego makes you very arrogant, horrible.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:29.549
But if you are humble, really, not to just
to have the humility of a businessman, but

00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:42.420
if you are humble from within yourself, from
your heart, enjoying your humility, then this

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.049
ego can run away.

00:46:44.049 --> 00:46:47.849
You have to ask yourself “Now what are you
angry for?”

00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:52.980
Again, I come back to the same point: introspection.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:47:02.800
Because you are not here just to carry on
some jobs, but you are here to become saints.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:11.940
Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of love and joy.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.099
You can, it is not difficult.

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:24.360
This one is what is ego is, reactions to things.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.980
You can react to things in a sweet way or
you can react to things in a deadly way.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:37.650
Then the humour comes in.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:47.740
Also you speak as if there is fragrant flowers
which are coming out.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:54.530
Then every action of yours, everything becomes
very gentle and sweet.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:48:04.279
Have this ego that will be gentle, will be
kind, will be sweet, will be forgiving, will

00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:05.279
be loving.

00:48:05.279 --> 00:48:08.109
Let’s have this ego.

00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:11.380
Start with this kind of a ego – the other
way round.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:18.289
You’ll be surprised how you can really conquer
the whole world.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:26.910
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is supposed
to tell something to his disciples about correcting

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.440
themselves.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.420
In my own sweet way I’ve said to you which
you shouldn’t mind.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:40.670
I don’t mean to condemn you by any chance
but to give you a proper sense of introspection,

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:47.599
proper sense of introspection by which you
all get your gurupada.

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:54.950
My only, I shouldn’t say desire, because
I don’t have desire.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:49:03.750
So my only vision is, that I should see all
the Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:15.440
love, enjoying each others love, enjoying
each others relationship, and improving relationships.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.210
I know there are problematic people, I know
they are problematic, but if you cannot solve

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:26.549
the problem what’s the use of your become
masters?

00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:43.160
So, I leave it to you to solve your own problems
which you are facing, and introspection with

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.160
love and compassion, not by condemning yourself.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.789
I am sure you can manage it.

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:51.420
May God bless you.

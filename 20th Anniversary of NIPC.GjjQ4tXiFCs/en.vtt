00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:04.332
The Creation of NIPC
July 2005 -New Jersey USA

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:08.852
NIPC was originally known as the
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi World Foundation

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:15.188
I would like to announce and therefore
it is a very unique and very auspicious

00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:24.938
day today that the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja
Yoga Foundation has been created today

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:33.018
and is going to be signed tomorrow. So
I would like you to give a big big clap.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:41.188
NIPC is Shri Mataji Corporation. It is Her
company. It is a legal entity that our beloved

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:49.828
Mother was the president is the president and always will be the president, to guide us.

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:58.308
NIPC was established under the direction of the Adi Shaki on the 21st of July 2005. Its purpose

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:05.108
is to preserve, protect and distribute our beloved Mother's sacred knowledge which is Her teachings,

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:12.548
lectures, writings and all recordings made in
Her presence. She transferred this intellectual

00:01:12.548 --> 00:01:22.868
Property to NIPC on the 16th of September 2005. It is the most auspicious and most precious company in

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:31.498
the history of mankind. It is beyond value.
It is a unique gift that will be there till the end of time. 

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:38.868
This is the first time that the original teachings of an incarnation

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:49.268
could be recorded and then preserved and
safeguarded. This is this was never possible in

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:59.908
the history of man. So NIPC is the first entity
ever that holds the treasure of the full teachings

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:05.348
not only of a Divine Incarnation but
of the Incarnation of Shri Adi Shakti Herself.

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:13.348
As we celebrate this 20 years of anniversary,
we are reminded of the impact and the importance

00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:21.988
of our mission. Each digital archive,
each restored speech, each shared teaching

00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:29.728
is a testament to the commitment to preserve, propagate the essence of spiritual knowledge,

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:34.998
spiritual awakening for the future generations. 

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:49.668
all of your talks and tapes. All of the talks
you've given over the years, 35 years of your

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:58.388
knowledge and teachings, the sacred knowledgeof Sahaj Yoga that you've given to us.

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:04.228
Now this foundation will manage them, will
modernize them and keep them forever and

00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:09.489
spread Your message throughout the world.
It's a very historic responsibility. Now

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:14.959
what you have to do is to authorize them.
Do you have signed that? Yes. Yeah. 

00:03:24.248 --> 00:03:27.508
what you write in?

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.508
Nirmala

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:32.638
It's okay. Okay.

00:03:32.638 --> 00:03:34.638
Nirmala is ok

00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:36.638
Nirmala

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:48.788
Is it okay? It's okay. Same here. Yeah.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:59.268
Two 3,000 talks Shri Mataji they will all now

00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:06.868
be preserved by this foundation and
it will be spread around the world.

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:09.273
Thank you

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:13.893
Shri Mataji on behalf of the Sahaja Yogis
of all the world

00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:16.358
and the people of all the world

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:21.862
the World Foundation, Your foundation
the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga Foundation

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:26.761
humbly and gratefully accept this
responsibility

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:37.188
to preserve your talks for all eternity Shri Mataj so they're available forever and ever for people all around the world.

00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:39.188
Jai Shri Mataji

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:47.508
This is forever and ever. Your word will
reach every corner of the world and it

00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:58.068
will go on and on and on until every human
being has become a Sahaja Yogi. That's the wish.

00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:02.344
20 years ago on the 16th of September in 2005,

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:09.211
a truly significant moment in the history of Sahaja Yoga occurred when Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.440
granted Her intellectual property to the recently formed

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.288
Nirmal Intellectual Property Corporation
or NIPC. In so doing, She ensured that Her Holy

00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:26.145
words and sacred knowledge would be preserved

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:30.758
and protected for future generations of seekers all over the world.

00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:37.828
Mother told us at that time, you have it now, you should protect it.

00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:46.548
So since then we develop a lot of work and I'm sure this work is going to continue protecting but

00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:51.013
also disseminating Her talks to the four corners of the world.

00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:54.068
There are over 3,000 events recorded

00:05:54.068 --> 00:06:04.708
with Shri Mataji some as early as 1972. NIPC's mission remains to preserve protect and distribute

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:12.868
Her sacred knowledge. Devi Productions does the work of preservation. Nirmala Vidya is the operating

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:20.028
arm of NIPC which protects the works amongst many other assignments. 

00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:24.368
Amruta and the Nirmal Vidya App are the distribution platforms. 

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:29.428
All this task is tremendous. There's a tremendous responsibility

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:37.188
and it is a very appropriate moment
to give sincerious appreciation and thanks

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:44.308
to everybody who has been working for this
momentous and and and most relevant and

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:54.068
important task. And it is of course also a moment to bow in gratitude and and eternal thanks to our

00:06:54.068 --> 00:07:02.468
Divine Mother, for this tremendous gift
to all of us and to humanity. And we are all

00:07:02.468 --> 00:07:13.348
working on it to make it available for today
and for tomorrow when perhaps as She once has said

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:16.238
Her teachings may become the law of men.

00:07:16.328 --> 00:07:30.068
Today NIPC is more than a platform. It is a radiant beacon of Divine love open to all transparent for all eternity and a universal spiritual treasure.

00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:36.708
Through Her Divine words and infinite
compassion, Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi revealed

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:43.668
the purity at the heart of every great
incarnation. Doras, Moses, Buddha,

00:07:43.668 --> 00:07:51.268
Confucius, Jesus and Prophet Muhammad and many others. Through Her travels across continent,

00:07:51.268 --> 00:08:00.948
She offered humanity the transformative knowledge. What Rumi called the light beyond all knowledge,

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:09.188
opening the door to mass self-realization. This is not just truth. It is living Divine reality

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:17.508
confirmed by science felt through Sahaja meditation and accessible to all seekers of absolute Truth.

00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:29.503
Her Divine presence awaken humanity to truth its source and inner rebirth all trench in Her Eternal love.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:39.632
Shri Mataji this knowledge is much greater
than the scriptures like Gita, Bible, Quran etc.

00:08:39.632 --> 00:08:48.671
I was involved since 1988 till 2005 in the work of Sahaja audio

00:08:48.671 --> 00:09:01.639
and Sahaja video in Delhi for preserving the originals and also making copies and supplying all over the India for cassettes and CDs.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:06.771
So I thanks Shri Mataji for that opportunity given to me.

00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:10.148
They are asking for your blessings Shri Mataji for the

00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:18.068
for the project of archiving and digitizing all
the old video talks and distributing them amongst

00:09:18.068 --> 00:09:19.123
the world.

00:09:19.123 --> 00:09:19.623
where?

00:09:19.623 --> 00:09:27.802
amongst all the Sahaja Yogis but
also some of them also to non-Sahaja Yogis so that everybody will see your your talks.

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:37.212
We used to we used to have video cassettes but now there's a new technology and we are
going to use these DVDs

00:09:37.212 --> 00:09:41.652
and they are going to be distributed and sold to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:43.462
That's my speech?

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:49.402
Yes Shri Mataji. This is one that's a DVD that's from one of those. Yes.

00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:57.023
And they will last for
a long time. They won't get spoiled by time.

00:09:57.023 --> 00:10:02.480
You know, earlier on the technology was not there, but they used to do some quality over time. Now

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:08.560
they have modernized it so that it will remain
as it is good quality for many years.

00:10:08.606 --> 00:10:10.640
In this puja you'll give?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.090
some of them.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:19.047
Yes. We will start selling now. We will have opened a stand and we will start selling to the Sahaja Yogis

00:10:19.063 --> 00:10:20.475
when?

00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:22.262
from tomorrow on.

00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:31.304
On the occasion of the 20 years of the creation of NIPC we would like to thank all
those who have contributed

00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:37.386
to the preservation of Shri Mataji's legacy, and particularly the team in Austria 

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.816
who under the leadership of Ossi

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:48.486
created Devi Productions the ship many original tapes from Italy to Austria, set up operations in

00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:58.148
Aussie and Susie's house, and started the process of cleaning, digitizing, and editing Mother's talks.

00:10:58.148 --> 00:11:07.828
 Over time, thousands of talks, audios, and videos have been preserved and made available to the public.

00:11:07.828 --> 00:11:14.948
Today, almost 20 years after the initial setup, the work of Devi Productions is still going on. 

00:11:14.948 --> 00:11:23.188
Unfortunately, our dear brother Ossi passed away, but the new team is active as

00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:31.748
ever in continuing this wonderful work. We are also remembering our dear brother Wolfgang who

00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:35.138
has always been a very strong supporter of Devi Productions work 

00:11:35.238 --> 00:11:38.808
and was always ready to find new ways to help them. 

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:44.548
We are Devi Production. We are the team here, the new current team in Vienna, Austria. 

00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:50.758
I'm Ben. I've been doing the videos the digitizations and producing the video content. 

00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:55.048
I'm Anton. I'm the audio guy in the
team and I'm taking care of all the audio tapes.

00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:59.278
Audio tapes digitization and optimization of the audio material. 

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:02.618
Hello, I'm Madu. I'm doing the IT department

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:08.228
in the Devi Production. Taking care of the workstations and the servers so that all

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.458
the work that has been digitized remains in the archive and everything works as it should.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:22.129
My name is Eric. I'm from Switzerland and I'm working for Nirmala Vidya. Nirmala Vidya was created by NIPC in 2011.

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:29.302
to pursue the mission of preserving and distributing and protecting all the

00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:38.228
recordings of Shri Mataji and enhance and
make it available for the collectivity to use it.

00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:45.988
What I just want to share is that first
it was a great privilege to be in this project

00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:52.315
this amazing project which is there for the future generation and hopefully for the eternity and

00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:58.775
but the thing is I was hired as a project manager and you know how it is in the professional world

00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:06.907
we plan we organize all what is what Shri Mataji laughed about it actually and that was really the

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:13.197
what I learned there is that in Sahaj when you have projects you just have to have the desire and

00:13:13.197 --> 00:13:20.127
the rest is all done by the Divine by the Adi Shakti. Like Shri Mataji explained in Delhi She build the house

00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:26.308
not just putting all the ingredients together so it's the same it was really the same was slowly

00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:31.087
putting all the ingredients the right people for
the right experience with the right knowledge and

00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:40.212
the right attitude and slowly brought us till
today where as you know we have Amuta,

00:13:40.242 --> 00:13:47.004
we have the App where we can connect every day with Shri Mataji through a speech, through videos,

00:13:47.044 --> 00:13:53.624
but also the production of the book with the Nirmala Vidya Collection Team, the amazing work that

00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:59.084
has been done to preserve all this content.
So it's a beautiful journey and it's not

00:13:59.084 --> 00:14:05.354
finished because the challenge are big now is to how to make use of all this knowledge to make it

00:14:05.354 --> 00:14:13.588
available also for the seekers properly to use
it properly to use the image properly in most

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:20.431
respectous way and manner and that's the challenge also with the advent of AI and

00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:25.491
that's the job is never ending I would say
and it's not a job actually it's just a blessing

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:33.415
to be that to be participating to that project and I hope I just can stay in

00:14:33.445 --> 00:14:36.705
the flow of what Mother wants to to be done
from us.

00:14:36.745 --> 00:14:45.575
Hello everyone, my name is Wadi and I've been helping the project since 2013 with
the mobile apps. 

00:14:45.735 --> 00:14:51.065
Hello, my name is Daher. I have been helping the project since my brother Wadi 

00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:55.545
joins to it. I always try to give a hand and try to do whatever is possible. 

00:14:55.668 --> 00:15:03.235
Since 2018, I begin to work full-time maintaining the apps and creating new

00:15:03.245 --> 00:15:11.908
features like song book, mantra book and also I joined to work with Radoslaw from Poland and we try to

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:16.744
keep all the content on Nirmala Vidya apps and Amruta website updated. 

00:15:16.774 --> 00:15:19.274
And we are working on a brand new

00:15:19.288 --> 00:15:26.622
version of the mobile apps okay with a
new design and new features. So please stay tuned.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:34.017
With regards to the future. AI artificial
intelligence is already playing a significant

00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:41.543
role and our Sahaja teams are actively exploring its potential. Unfortunately the other side of

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:51.748
the coin exists AI artificial insanity where
deep fake videos of Mother are a big concern.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:16:00.033
We urge yogis to stay alert to such misuse and also to those who are monetizing sahaja yoga.

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:09.439
We humbly ask yogis only to use the NIPC platforms : Amruta and the Nirmala Vidya app as they provide authentic

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:12.409
unaltered teachings of Shri Mataji, 

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:21.619
unlike platforms such as YouTube which may contain edited content and disruptive adverts.  

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:31.672
NIPC preserves the purity and integrity of Shri Mataji's original messages making it the only reliable source.

00:16:31.672 --> 00:16:40.549
 Nirmal Vidya the spoken and written words of Shri Adi Shakti

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:45.969
is the ultimate template for the
emancipation and salvation of all of

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:56.007
humanity to our evolution to our upliftment
to all the solutions of our problems.

00:16:56.067 --> 00:17:06.437
It's the gateway to Her holy lotus
feet. It's the highway to heaven.

00:17:06.457 --> 00:17:12.018
It's the key to that golden gate and
it's the meeting place of our Sahasrara

00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:15.038
with that of the Sahasrara of the Virat. 

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:28.403
We don't have the the words the vocabulary to express that gratitude and thanks.

00:17:28.463 --> 00:17:35.588
But our Holy Mother with Her infinite compassion and love and forbearance and patience and generosity

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:46.597
accepts our thanks in whatever meager words which can we can express it. 

00:17:46.597 --> 00:17:54.688
So, Shri Mataji for all the knowledge and everything else that you have given us we express our

00:17:54.718 --> 00:18:00.268
heartfelt and deep gratitude to you. Thank
you Shri Mataji.

00:18:00.318 --> 00:18:03.532
Thank you very much and happy anniversary.

00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:10.192
So really want to thank all of you. Thank very importantly Shri Mataji for this beautiful opportunity.

00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:12.042
Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:14.732
Thank you again to all of you.

00:18:14.874 --> 00:18:17.412
Jai Shri Mataji, all my love. 

00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:19.072
Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:19.072 --> 00:18:20.854
Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:20.854 --> 00:18:22.744
Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:23.744 --> 00:18:29.908
Beloved Mother, it has been the
greatest honor of my life to serve you. It is

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:39.802
with deep gratitude and humility. I thank
you from the very deepest part of my heart. Jai Shri Mataji

00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:45.123

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.600
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.110
It was a thing of great joy to Me to come
to Sheffield again.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.800
Always this name Sheffield created a kind
of a mystery in My mind.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.020
The word Sheffield could be the ‘She Field’
and She is the Mother energy, the energy within

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.390
you which creates this field within you and
is in the Gita.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.440
Shri Krishna has talked about the field that
we all have a Pradesh - is the field but Desh

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.320
means the field and the enlightened one is
the Pradesh.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.469
And that same thing happens to us when this
Kundalini rises within you.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.800
This Holy Ghost which is described in the
bible, She is the Kundalini, She is the Mother.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.180
Actually people don’t know anything about
Holy Ghost and we didn’t give Christ much

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.830
chance to speak about it.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.220
He could only speak for three and a half years,
is nothing.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.580
I can tell you three and a half years in this
land anywhere in the whole world it’s so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.090
difficult even to convince four people that
they have to seek the truth, it’s very difficult.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.490
Especially in the land where He was born.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.540
It was full of ignorance, complete ignorance.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.840
And in that ignorance to speak about realization,
to speak about second birth, even to speak

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.670
about God was so difficult.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.951
And He was just crucified for nothing at all,
today we may have big organizations in His

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:09.770
name but when He lived nobody listened to
Him and they crucified Him.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.290
He talked about Holy Ghost but this Holy Ghost
had been interpreted by people in various

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.290
ways.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.189
They’ve never been able to say what is this
Holy Ghost but logically you can come to some

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.859
conclusion yourselves because you’re all
intelligent people.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.680
We talk about the Father, all right, and then
the Son.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.599
Have you heard of a father producing a son?

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.370
You have to have the Mother.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.640
It’s the Mother who creates the Son.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.770
Now why this Holy Ghost was kept as a secret,
never talked about it because Christ was afraid

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.749
– not afraid but was cautious I should say,
because such people are never afraid of anything.

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:04.120
He was cautious to talk about His Mother because
if they had harmed His Mother by any chance,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.599
then He had eleven powers of destruction and
the destruction of world would have come much

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.390
earlier than today.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.010
He had to play the whole drama of His crucifixion
and that’s how He had to go through all

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.010
that.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.120
In that process He didn’t want to involve
His Mother.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.110
He didn’t want to explain about Holy Ghost
and He knew that it will be later on explained.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.529
But logically we must understand what is this
Holy Ghost we are talking about?

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.529
[A dove?]

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:36.529
All right, it’s peace.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.930
How do you get to the peace?

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.930
Supposing it is the symbol of peace.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.719
Today we see in the world we see these televisions
and we hear, we read newspapers and we are

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:57.090
shattered and so much of friction, so much
of sin.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.650
People are not even worried about what they
are doing, to what extent human beings can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:11.040
go you can see the way a three year-old child
was molested, the innocence is attacked like

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
this.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
Why?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.790
Why human beings cannot control their desires
which are so devilish?

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.590
Why there is so much of friction in this world?

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.430
We have to think about it and we must also
think positively what we can do about it.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.131
Now at the same time there are so many seekers
of truth born on this earth.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:35.600
This is the special time and that’s why
they are born on this earth.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.390
But they are misled, they go to wrong people,
they get identified with wrong people.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.620
When I came here, the person who is organizing
Sahaja Yoga here told Me that, “Mother,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210
they come, they get their realization and
then they disappear, they start doubting.”

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.170
I said, “That’s a good sign, it’s a
healthy sign.”

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.540
Let them doubt because the way they jump into
all these horrible things like gurus and this

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.400
and that, the way they accept as if they have
no personality, they have no discretion.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.210
The way they jump into even drugs I don’t
know, what happens that we have lost all our

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.210
personality.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.860
They took to any fashion, to any nonsense
so easily and to reality with such difficulty.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.620
We have lost our discretion that’s what
it is, but doesn’t matter whatever it is

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.270
use your brains.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.430
Understand that this world is not created
to be destroyed.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.370
You’re not created out of amoeba just to
be destroyed by something nonsensical like

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.040
drug(s) or some sort of a guru; nobody has
right to destroy you.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.270
They cannot create you and they cannot destroy
you, nor you have any right to destroy yourself

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.920
because you cannot create yourself, the one
who is your Creator, the one who has loved

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:10.180
you who has so beautifully made this beautiful
human life is responsible.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.710
He is the one who is so earnest about it that
you should get your realization, that you

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.740
should get your second birth, that you should
be baptized in the real sense of the word.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:31.130
I agree religions have shown funny things,
some thing so absurd that one can start doubting

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.220
their credibility.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.830
I admit that, but that is the mistake of human
beings not of the divine.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.370
Divine created beautiful flowers on the same
tree of life time and time again but when

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.110
the people plucked these flowers and said,
“These are mine, these are mine.”

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.830
They became dead and ugly and they are fighting
now in the name of God, in the name of religion.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:08.490
Imagine, how can you do such merciless, horrible,
brutal things to other human beings but this

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.200
must shatter you, this must make you understand
and you should be aware.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.740
Get out of your sleep now and know that you
are the people who are seekers.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.340
You have to be more aware, more understanding
of your responsibility.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.910
It is no use standing there with a banner
saying we want peace.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.910
How?

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.680
The peace has to be within.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.950
Human beings are not at peace.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:41.170
You see in the art you see today the art has
left the Divine behind, the art has become

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.570
so, chaotic.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.200
The expression of esthetics are just missing
there’s no beauty in it.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.620
You feel the chaotic heart of an artist being
expressed in that what he’s made, why?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.770
Because he has lost himself.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:08.450
Now it is the responsibility of you people
living in these modern times to become that,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:16.240
that source of peace, which is your Spirit,
and the Spirit resides within you.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.770
It is all the time there it is the witness
of this field I should say the She Field,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.920
the field that is to be enlightened by this
Kundalini that exists within you but is not

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.760
enlightened, it has not come into your attention.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.279
The Spirit has not come into your attention,
that’s why we think this is all talk.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:43.479
There are people who are so called intellectuals;
they say this is all talk, talk, talk.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:53.230
For a mental conception it is impossible to
tell what lies beyond it because mind is a

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.230
limited thing.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.510
You have to go beyond mind; you have to be
triggered into the space to see that.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:04.879
The evolution has been just like your spacecraft
going into the space.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:13.160
First, the first thing comes up is the physical
being, explodes gets its accelerations then

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.470
becomes your mental being, your emotional
being, your spiritual being and then it has

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.089
to go to the space.

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:25.560
That is the time today is the space age.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:32.230
When we talk of the space age you think of
the space, which is beyond this gravity, there

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:39.459
is some space, which is beyond all gravities,
beyond all temptations, beyond all slaveries.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:43.660
We talk of our freedom, where is the freedom
I just don’t think see.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.439
Anybody comes now and says all right, have
this drug for so much money.

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:49.680
We are finished with it.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.240
Anybody comes and says all right, you take
up your clothes this way, live like this,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.660
we just accept without thinking, without understanding.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.800
We have given up the traditions alright whatever
was wrong in the tradition should have been

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.680
given no doubt but everything if you give
up then remember we are falling down.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.699
We are coming down we are not going up.

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:17.089
When you are going up you do not give up the
staircase.

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:21.309
Staircase is there and you go up higher and
higher.

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:28.959
No tradition is so bad is to be discarded
but if it is so it should be discarded but

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:35.449
that is what is the discretion and that discretion
is so much lacking today that people can’t

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:43.860
see that what we are doing collectively or
individually is not constructive.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.660
Now I would say that this is not the time
for us just to sit back on the fence and see

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.949
which side we fall.

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:57.060
Either you will fall into hell or you’ll
go to heaven.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.779
This is the situation, we are so precariously
placed, I do not want to frighten you because

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:09.269
there is the Spirit within you just to be
enlightened, it’s your own, it is there,

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:11.560
it’s your own property.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.160
It’s not Mine, it’s yours, it’s your
own treasure within you.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.130
Only this treasure is to be exposed to you.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.449
Now for that how can you pay?

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:25.430
First thing you must know you cannot pay for
it.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.769
If I say that then all the gurus are after
My life, they want to kill Me, they want to

00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:31.240
do all those things.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.440
You cannot take money for God’s work.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.370
We sold Christ, you know that.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.240
He didn’t take any money, did He?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.270
We have got such a great personality like
Christ and we just want to discard Him, make

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:50.000
fun of Him, say all kinds of things about
Him, intellectualize Him, organize Him.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.529
You cannot touch Him.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.759
You’re still human beings, you have to be
the Spirit to understand that Great Soul which

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:57.769
came on this earth.

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:03.040
In the same way any other soul, which was
an Incarnation who came on this earth, cannot

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:12.380
be understood by our normal understanding,
but only a person with that pure intelligence

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:18.160
can see this point that I’m not satisfied
with what I am, I have to go beyond.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.059
There’s some transformation needed and how
will this transformation take place?

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:30.240
We can’t do anything about it because we
have done nothing to become human beings did

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.890
we?

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.490
What did we do to become human beings?

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:41.160
Nothing, so going beyond also must be built
in within us.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.680
The way we became human beings there must
be some built-in process by which we will

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.290
become that higher being.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:56.040
Now the problem at the human level is that
somebody has to talk at human level.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:03.519
Say at the fish level, one fish had to come
up so the others could follow that fish.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:08.769
At human level, some human being has to tell
you about it.

00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:10.899
That’s how Christ came on this earth.

00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:18.519
I mean we have a quite a long traditional
history of all these great people came on

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:21.610
this earth at different places, at different
times.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.240
According to the time they had to talk.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.610
When they talked say, about the flowers, say
they talked that they are Gods, like Socrates

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.600
talked about Gods, like Confucius talked about
Gods.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.509
When they talked we have to please our gods
we started doubting.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:44.050
What god’s he’s talking about?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.629
Whatever they saw we could not see, all right.

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:51.100
Then they thought no use talking about gods.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.720
If you talk about gods then it becomes a sort
of a worship of something that is a flower.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.300
We talk about flowers then we think we have
become God and we talk about flower all the

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.610
time.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.550
But we have to get to the honey.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.790
How do we do it?

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:13.529
So they said, “All right, don’t talk about
God, talk about abstract, talk about the fragrance,

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:14.899
talk about the honey itself.”

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:20.750
But how do you become, how do you get to the
honey?

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.929
By talking about it again it became a talk
and talk and talk.

00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:34.869
So how it has to happen that you have to become
the bee, the transformation has to take place.

00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:41.129
First understand this simple point that some
transformation has to take place within us

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:51.869
to go or to penetrate into that unknown divine
which we call as collective unconscious.

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:56.640
Something has to happen to us that we have
to become subtler beings.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.559
Don’t be satisfied and don’t self certify
yourself that “I’m all right; nothing

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.689
wrong with me.”

00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:06.529
No, nothing’s wrong with you.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:10.560
Y0ou’re all right, but you have still to
be connected to the mains.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.769
Like this instrument, if it is not connected
to the mains it won’t work.

00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:22.279
It is as simple as this instrument that you
are to be connected with the mains and for

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:27.490
that you have got built-in process that has
to work out.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:33.540
It’s nice we have instruments in these modern
times that I can use them as an analogies

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.939
to explain to you.

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:42.180
For others they had to use the analogies of
the seed that how we imbed the seed in the

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:48.399
Mother Earth and the Mother Earth has the
capacity to sprout the seed and the seed has

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.019
the built-in map of all the trees it is going
to create.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:58.209
Now if you look at the seed do you see the
miracle behind the little seed there?

00:15:58.209 --> 00:16:02.699
In India we have huge big banyan trees and
if you see the seed is so small that it’s

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:08.110
quite microscopic and it makes huge big banyan
trees.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.189
How does it make?

00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:10.410
We never wonder.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.889
Whatever is the wonder, the mystery of this
creation we never wonder about it, we never

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:19.189
look at it, look at ourselves, what are we?

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:22.809
We are human beings, these eyes, can we make
eyes like this.

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:27.540
We are making computers, but look at this
brain the computer that is within, we don’t

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.629
have to program it nothing it just knows.

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:34.790
You know I’m sitting here, I know you’re
sitting here just looking at it.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:41.589
You don’t have to go through the process
of finding out what is the process of it and

00:16:41.589 --> 00:16:45.480
then it moves the whole thing and gives you
the program and out of the program something

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.810
comes out.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.610
It is there just at the same instant you know
what is it.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.600
This kind of a computer is made for us, why?

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:04.610
To be wasted, to be confused, to be ended
up in a lunatic asylum?

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.319
We must have the proper value system about
ourselves.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:15.689
First of all we are human beings made from
amoeba to this stage in thousands of years

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:21.630
with great care and delicacy, for what purpose
we must ask the question, why are we made?

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:27.579
Are we made here just to ruin ourselves or
not to do anything just like blind people

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.679
going about hitting here hitting there.

00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:38.950
No, we are made to become the Spirit and the
whole system is built-in within you.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:44.809
And we have to go into another realm of our
awareness into a new dimension.

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:48.240
Now these dimensions can be also misinterpreted.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:55.399
It’s such a dangerous line we are into because
these modern times are full of horrible people.

00:17:55.399 --> 00:18:01.190
Like somebody says that “All right, I can
hear voices."

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.190
So what?

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.580
"I can see light."

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.330
So what?

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:12.399
Or somebody says that, "All right, I feel
like I’m flying in the air, I leave my body."

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:13.399
So what?

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:16.080
What have you got?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.559
You are under the control of something else,
you don’t know anything.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:26.190
Logically you must know what you are doing,
what’s happening to you, what is within

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.740
you, you must know each and everything.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:36.549
You have to know that if I have become the
light then I must have the power of the light,

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:37.930
I don’t see the light.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.370
If I see the light I’m not the light.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.840
If I become the light, then I have the power
of light.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:54.620
In the light you see clearly and that is what
you get is collective consciousness.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:01.440
You can feel another person’s Chakras, you
can feel your centers and if you know how

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.040
to cure that, how to improve that and how
to raise the Kundalini which is a very, very

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.130
simple thing - because it is so fundamental
that’s why it is so simple.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:23.100
You can cure yourself, you can cure others
and you can live very joyously within yourself.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:30.600
This is what you have to have and that’s
how you will realize that we are part and

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.640
parcel of the whole.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.669
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm.

00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:44.970
Not by talking about it by saying about it
by mental projections no, it happens to you,

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:56.529
it really happens to you when you become the
spirit, it works on your central nervous system,

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:01.779
you know what you are and what others are.

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:10.860
That they’re part and parcel of you is known
to you on your central nervous system.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:16.789
So we come to conclusion that if we have to
become the Spirit what should we do?

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:17.789
Nothing.

00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:22.460
What do we do when we put the seed in the
Mother Earth?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:28.390
Nothing, but once you become that then you
have to look after it.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:34.610
When the seed is sprouted, comes out of the
Mother Earth then we have to look after it,

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:39.990
and that’s the point where most of the western
people fail.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.990
The reason is this knowledge is not known
to them.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.730
Their knowledge is like the tree, which is
exposed outside.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.799
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:58.200
This is the knowledge of the roots and we
have to give and take.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.990
We have to talk about it; we have to understand
that there’s nothing like India and England

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.350
two different things.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:15.980
England I call it the heart of the universe,
it is, and India is the Kundalini of the universe.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:23.690
The Kundalini has to know England and England
has to know the Kundalini.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:31.559
If it is one whole body then one part has
to know another part.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:44.140
So all your misconceptions, or conceptions,
or maybe right ideas are all become absolutely

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:51.419
evident, vividly seen because you get the
light of your own Spirit.

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:52.850
That Spirit is missing.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.419
That Spirit which is all the time watching
you, witnessing you has to be enlightened

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:04.690
in the sense that the Spirit must enlighten
your attention.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:11.549
That’s how you become the attention and
wherever you put the attention you act.

00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:18.920
It’s very surprising, like if you’re watching
the television, watching the television, it’s

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.820
unreal and you’re looking at the television.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:28.679
They cannot act on you and you cannot act
on them because it is artificial.

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:31.600
But supposing there’s a gentleman sitting.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.480
He’s a living body not artificial you are
talking to that person and that person is

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.529
talking to you it acts.

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:45.440
But this attention which is a subtler being
within you - your attention - supposing you

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.070
project it to someone and it acts for the
benevolence, never for destruction but for

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.110
the benevolence.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:58.799
When it acts for the benevolence you are amazed,
how does it happen?

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:03.510
How can my attention have the power of benevolence?

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:09.030
Because in your attention is now the light
of the Spirit.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.549
So you become benevolent.

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:19.700
You know the truth whether it is true or not.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.210
How will you know?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:27.840
I was once in Pune and you see in England
they say I’m preaching, I’m preaching

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.860
about Hinduism, I’m converting everybody
to Hindus.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.049
And in India they say I’m converting them
to Christianity - because I’m doing both

00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:40.880
you see, [laughter from Shri Mataji and from
the audience] So they have a great objection

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.169
about Me everywhere because they don’t see
the integrated work about Sahaja Yoga, all

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.169
right?

00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:54.121
So they said that “This is wrong, whatever
She’s saying is not correct because we are

00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:58.399
Brahmins and we know about our shastras and
we are Brahmins.”

00:23:58.399 --> 00:24:00.000
But they didn’t tell Me all this.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.789
They talked all these things to others and
they said, “We can’t have Her in our hall,

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:09.899
She’s not a Brahmin and She’s in a Christian
family we can’t have Her.”

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:14.909
So the Brahmins, as usual all priests as they’re
always against the truth you see they were

00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:16.320
against the truth there also as Brahmins.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:23.240
I didn’t know all these things but suddenly
I felt and I said, "Whosoever are Brahmins

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.260
among you please come forward."

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.110
So four five you see very hefty people came
and sat in front like this.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.070
I said," Really are you Brahmins?"

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.070
“Yes” they said.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.009
“All right, all put your hands towards Me,
like this.”

00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:40.799
They put their hands like this towards Me
and what happened that they start shaking

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.799
like this.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:42.799
I said, “What’s happening?

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:43.860
Stop it, why are shaking?

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.510
He said to the others who are there they are
also shaking.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.620
I said yes but ask them from where they come.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:55.289
They said we are certified lunatics coming
from a lunatic asylum [audience laughs] because

00:24:55.289 --> 00:25:00.360
Mother has cured some lunatics so we are sitting
here.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.530
Then they realized that they were also quite
lunatic [audience laughs again] because they’re

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.530
fundamentalists.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:11.500
If you go to extremes you become lunatic,
I mean lunatics at least can be put in the

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.860
lunatic asylum but these people are going
around everywhere, you don’t know how to

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.620
control them, all over the world they are
creating such problems every, every country

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.620
has them.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.220
Somewhere they are very sophisticated so you
can’t make them out somewhere they are very

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.759
closed so you know they are there but some
are can be very subtle you can’t make them

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:36.740
out but you cannot make them budge from whatever
they are holding onto.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.710
So this is how relatively first you realize
what is the Truth.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:49.419
With these vibrations, with the vibrations
that flow that you feel when the Kundalini

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:55.850
crosses through your Brahmarandra as they
call it, we can call the fontanel bone area

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:01.279
you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost coming out of your head.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:07.570
Then also you start feeling sometimes little
late in your fingers the cool breeze coming

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.570
in.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.110
Now some people are very proud, "Oh, I’m
not feeling anything."

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.830
That’s not a good thing; if you’re not
feeling there’s something wrong.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.940
Somewhere something missing, normally you
should.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:26.429
Children feel it very fast because they’re
so innocent, not yet spoiled by anything.

00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:31.250
They are not so egoistical; they do not have
these barriers.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.609
Some sort of problem is there that you’re
not feeling the cool breeze.

00:26:34.609 --> 00:26:40.190
You should because this is the All Pervading
Power of God which surrounds us, is everywhere

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.020
and every one of you should feel that cool
breeze.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:50.780
Once you start feeling the cool breeze then
you become the joy because first of course

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.960
you want to try with everything.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.990
"Is it cool breeze?

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.019
Is it cool breeze?

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:55.420
That is cool breeze.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.500
Should I go or not?

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.740
Let me see now, if it is cool breeze I’ll
go otherwise."

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.620
You go on like that.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:14.260
Then you realize this is the truth, this is
the truth, and then the joy of finding the

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260
truth emerges.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.760
But in India it’s just the other way round.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.350
They’re not bothered because they know what
happens.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.690
They know; they have the knowledge of the
roots, so they know what is to be found out.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:32.149
We don’t have to go very far, even, so near,
I mean, few years back we should say was,

00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:35.580
we had Nanaka, we had Kabira.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:42.570
They talked about it very clearly they told
about this so vividly that anybody with any

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.519
sense should understand.

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:53.139
Especially Kabira who was such a great poet
and such a great incarnation, I would say

00:27:53.139 --> 00:28:02.779
the way he talked right from all these Brahmins
to all the hypocrites and everything he gave

00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:06.270
them left and right.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.340
He was like Saint Michael with a sword in
his hand cutting everybody.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.139
Like your William Blake, he was really like
your William Blake who gave left and right

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:17.539
to all these nonsensical people.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:22.240
He has talked about it, he very clearly describing
Sahaj.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.450
He said, Nanaka has said (???) you can only
get Samadhi through Sahaja.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.669
Sahaja means spontaneous, only spontaneously
can you get it.

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:37.279
Then you have got Kabira who was treated like
a (shidule?)

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.779
caste.

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:39.909
Like a (shidule?)

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:42.179
caste he was treated.

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.879
Nobody respected him.

00:28:43.879 --> 00:28:49.659
Then we had Ramdas another one a great man
I’m told, there is a temple of this Ramdas.

00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:54.340
I was so amazed that in England it should
come and prosper.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.210
They were treated just like (shidule?)

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.909
caste by these people nobody would listen
to them.

00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:05.100
Nobody would allow them to come in a temple,
these great saints, because they were not

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:12.260
be a born in a Brahmin family; and these great
people have talked, Nanaka has talked very

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.590
clearly, very recently they have talked about
these things.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.230
Hundred years back only.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.640
William Blake has talked about Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:29.029
He has said, "The men of God, men of God"
- that’s you - "will become prophets and

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:32.750
they will have powers to make others prophet."

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:38.860
He had such hopes of making England into Jerusalem,
but where are those English?

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.200
I have still to meet many.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.419
I’ve worked in this country for twelve years,
relentlessly.

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:52.850
India I’ve worked very little but we have
thousand fold people who have got realization

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.650
in India.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:30:01.580
They may be poor but they know what they have
to get, to them to get to their self realization

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.789
is the thing.

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:09.649
Nothing else matters, they do not intellectualize,
they know already this is it, this is it.

00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:18.870
Everyone knows, right from President downward
everyone knows what to expect, but whatever

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:25.649
is our knowledge has been, we have to know
that this outside knowledge whatever we have

00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:29.070
has to have roots and we have to go to our
roots.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.380
We cannot live with this outside knowledge,
we have to know ourselves.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.159
Everybody is talking about self-knowledge.

00:30:37.159 --> 00:30:44.770
There have been so many books, so many things,
I mean so much of seeking is on, that we cannot

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:52.330
just avoid getting to our spirit, we have
to get to it but the only problem where I

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:58.629
stumble down is that people do not have (?). They’re
very frivolously treating the whole thing,

00:30:58.629 --> 00:31:04.499
those who have got realization for them the
Kingdom of God is awaiting.

00:31:04.499 --> 00:31:10.570
They are not only welcome but they’ll be
cherished and that’s what has to be done.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:16.519
You have to cherish your Spirit, your Self
- you’ve not done it.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:21.840
Only just getting realization, feeling satisfied
about it itself is not sufficient.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.300
“Now I’m realized, all right, I’ve got
the cool breeze, I’m this.”

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.539
No, you have to grow.

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:32.380
It’s still a sapling that has to grow, for
that you don’t have to pay anything, nothing.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:38.519
Here these people, really I tell you, they
are working so hard because they have achieved

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:41.659
a certain height in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:41.659 --> 00:31:42.980
They don’t take any money.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.400
They were just like you, they had to work
hard to first establish themselves, because

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.419
that is the time where people want to say,
"No, Mother said Sahaj, so all right, we’ll

00:31:53.419 --> 00:31:54.809
sit at home."

00:31:54.809 --> 00:32:00.639
That is only for sprouting I said Sahaj, but
we have to look after because we have had

00:32:00.639 --> 00:32:07.210
conditionings, we have had problems, we have
had physical problems, we have had social

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.210
problems, we have had psychological problems.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:18.299
They are to be attended to and the Kundalini
just goes and raise this energy there.

00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:26.379
Unless and until you know how to maneuver
it or work it out, it is very difficult for

00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:29.740
this Kundalini to manage by Herself.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.299
You have to show the will.

00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:35.039
If you do not have the will nobody can force
on you.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:37.230
The Divine is not going to fall at your feet.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.379
"All right, all right, get your realization."

00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:45.000
You have to knock at the door, and these doors
are only six - not many.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.230
Six doors which are partly opened out, again
closing, again opening out.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:57.279
You have to just know how to knock and how
to keep them open, finished.

00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:01.429
Then you become the light, and once you become
the light you give light to others.

00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:04.039
That’s how this world is going to be saved.

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:08.049
No other way out, no other way out.

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:11.429
We have to have transformation; we have to
become the Spirit.

00:33:11.429 --> 00:33:23.960
We have to be enlightened and to be the light
in the Great Being that is our Creator, our

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.870
Preserver and the One who is our existence
itself.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:34.350
All these things are so simple.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:43.820
They may look bombastic when we see from outside,
but when you come inside it’s so simple,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.840
it’s very easy.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.330
Sahaj also has another meaning that’s “very
easy” - apart from it is spontaneous, it

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.470
is very easy.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.769
We don’t want to do something easy.

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:57.200
Like if we can eat our food like this we’ll
not, we’ll have to take our hand like this,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.220
and if you can eat in a difficult way then
it’s very good.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.590
That’s human nature.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.179
They want to do something like that.

00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:09.179
Like some people suggested to Me, "Mother
when You go to India and settle down there,

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:13.119
then we’ll make these people that, ‘If
you have to get realization, you have to go

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:14.119
to Mother.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:19.050
Then you must stay on a mountaintop where
there will be freezing cold.’

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.470
Let them climb up seven miles and then they
will come to You and they’ll get their realization.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:28.780
Otherwise they will not because their ego
will not be satisfied with given things."

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.079
What about Me?

00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:33.050
I don’t want to trouble you, why should
you?

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.590
I’ve taken all the troubles; Christ has
taken all the troubles for you.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:42.109
Everybody has taken troubles, you better enjoy
now.

00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:46.879
You have to enjoy it; just you have to get
it.

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:49.990
There’s no end to My lectures.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:57.630
I’ve been lecturing and lecturing and lecturing
and I would say that this subject is so interesting

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.490
that all here there are at least 60 percent
people who must have heard thousands of My

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.490
lectures.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.890
Still they would like to hear more and more
[Shri Mataji laughs as She speaks] so I would

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:12.410
suggest that we finish at this point, but
know that once you become the knowledge it’s

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.290
easier to understand what we are saying.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.770
It’s very simple but only thing you have
to become the Spirit.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.280
May God Bless You.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.270
Now I would like to have some questions but
I’ve seen people when they ask questions

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:31.960
they are representatives of some horrid gurus.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.109
Their horrid gurus pay them some money because
they take a lot of money then they pay them

00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:37.109
some money.

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:39.380
Then they come here as identified with these
gurus.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.680
I have to request them what have you got out
of that guru?

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.290
Why are you so much enamored by him?

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:50.380
Why are you so much charmed by that, what
have you got?

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:55.660
He’s using you.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:02.660
So please when you ask questions ask independently,
freely, I’ll be very happy to answer you

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.140
but I don’t like that you are talking because
somebody has told you something.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:25.490
Whatever you know you ask me I’ll be very
happy to answer those questions to you.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:51.410
May God bless you.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:37:01.770
Question: You mentioned Christ, you mentioned
the Holy Ghost, you mentioned the Kundalini.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:06.790
If Christ is the Son, what is the Kundalini?

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.510
Shri Mataji: She is the Mother.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:17.460
Christ within us is the Spirit and Kundalini
is the Holy Ghost, which is the Mother.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:26.809
The reflection of Holy Ghost within us is
the Kundalini and the reflection of Christ

00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:41.339
within us is the spirit.

00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:44.349
But everybody has played the role.

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:55.840
Like Moses, like Abraham, like Socrates, like
Lao Tze, everybody has played the role to

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.590
build up this drama they are all part and
parcel of one being.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.250
This one you must understand.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:06.430
When they said there is one God, he’s not
like rock of Gibraltar.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:13.740
Even rock of Gibraltar has got different molecules
you see but to ask God is one means, I don’t

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.290
know, I can not think of such thing just a
one block.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:27.890
He’s not, He has many aspects and these
aspects are expressed in these different ways.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:38.490
Of course He’s one, united, integrated,
one; but all these aspects are there, and

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:45.339
this one God is either in the pockets of the
priests or the pockets of the Brahmins or

00:38:45.339 --> 00:38:52.340
the pockets of the mullahs or the pockets
of someone.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:39:02.050
One God.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:15.740
Question: Does the Kundalini have any relationship
to the Virgin Mary, the physical Mother of

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.740
Jesus?

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.740
Shri Mataji: It is, very much so.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.760
Yes you asked the same question.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:30.661
She is the Virgin the (kanya?) but gradually
when you come to Sahaja Yoga you will know

00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:37.780
the Virgin Mary, what is Her exposure is,
how many times She was born even in India,

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:46.490
what is Her relationship and how great She
is.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.800
But why Martin Luther did not talk about Virgin
Mary?

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.710
I asked My father who was a realized soul
and he gave a good explanation.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:40:00.280
He said it was (?) it means according to the
circumstances at the time, that time suddenly

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:10.230
he found that he has to take the people in
a more enlightened field and he is doing so

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:15.810
he wanted Muslims also to be included, and
if you suddenly talk about the Mother, they

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.339
may not accept.

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:28.810
So for that he avoided, but actually he knew
that one day somebody will explain.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:35.950
But human nature is such I must say that if
you accept one flower, you’ll not accept

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:42.339
another, and when they’re dead - not when
they’re living, never, never.

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:46.030
When they’re living we’ll never accept
it, we’ll never listen to them.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:53.020
But once they’re dead then wonderful because
he’s in our pocket, do what you like, it’s

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.560
very common.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:01.570
We had one Gyaneshwara, a great saint in India,
very great saint and they have built huge

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:05.980
big temple for him and he is in a statue.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.450
So when we went there they said, "You cannot
do meditation here."

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.450
I said, "Why?

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.630
What did he do?

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.630
He did meditation."

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.170
He said, "No, you have to do that kind of
a dance they do called (?)"

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.020
I said, "But he did not do it.'

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.000
He said, "So what?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.570
We do this way.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.860
He was another; he was great.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.450
We are not so we have to do this"

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.330
So I didn’t know how to argue at with that,
so I said, "Look at the statue.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.690
Now you are in a statue, better come in a
form to tell all these people.”

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.650
But when he came in form he didn’t even
have shoes to wear.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:44.010
He burnt his feet on charred grounds.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.930
Nobody gave him water to drink.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:47.930
All the saints suffered.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.930
Any other question please?

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:49.930
Yes.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:56.059
Question: Do you need to believe in God to
get realization, like Buddha didn’t believe

00:41:56.059 --> 00:42:01.390
in God but still got realization.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:08.571
Shri Mataji: All right, Buddha did not believe
that’s not the point - He did believe but

00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:10.030
He didn’t say about God.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:35.680
I also didn’t say in the beginning about
God, because if you start talking about God

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.280
it creates problems.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.660
That he said all these things because, why,
that’s what I’m trying to tell you.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.579
You see it is (?) the time, that time.

00:42:46.579 --> 00:42:54.000
What he thought that the people in India especially
were worshipping a God in a temple, the Brahmins,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.040
this, that.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.560
The Brahmins thought this is a God; they had
pocketed all the money and all those things.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.710
So how to bring them out of it?

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.790
He said, “Don’t talk of God; don’t talk
of anything.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:06.920
Talk of the Self.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.500
First step is Self.”

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.500
He said, “First they will have the Self,
then they will know where is the God.”

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.970
Of course in the temple also we have some
things, which we can say are swayambus, which

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.040
are, come out of Mother Earth.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:28.890
It is said in one of the commandments that
whatever is created by Mother Earth or by

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:34.780
the heavens should not be reproduced, but
there is something created.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:45.660
So these temples were all completely monopolized
by Brahmins and these Brahmins tried to rule

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.990
the whole country, that’s the thing happened.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:55.340
So Buddha thought, how to get these people
out and He talked about the Self only and

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.340
nothing else.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.549
He said, “First Self”, and I also felt
the same way in the beginning.

00:43:59.549 --> 00:44:02.640
but now the time is different.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:09.130
Now I would say that it can go to any extent
this stupidity of these fundamentalists.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:16.780
Like in Nasik when Mahatma Gandhi returned
from England they said, “You have to go

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.220
for (? Chitta)” - means a repentance – “You
have to go in for repentance because you put

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.880
your foot on a foreign land.”

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880
Imagine!

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.180
And they would not allow him to exist.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.430
They would not allow him to exist and he had
to do it.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:37.700
He said, “Now get rid of these mad people.”

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:45.200
He had to do it and it was a Brahmin who killed
him ultimately.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:52.880
So I mean, it’s a very funny world, you
know and in that world we come and we tell

00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:01.800
about something that is truth - which is truth,
which is good, which is benevolent, which

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.370
is the thing, but people just kill.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.280
I mean there is no need - at least if you
don’t want to hear, all right.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.790
Don’t kill them, but they kill.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:22.080
Even Mohammed Sahib was given poison, even
Buddha was tortured by the people, very much

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:29.970
tortured in the beginning and His disciples
also went to extremes later on, not his own

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.030
disciples but his followers.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:39.369
So now we have people who beat the seekers
on their back.

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:43.010
We had one gentleman, his name was, he called
himself Omkar.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:51.270
He came from some Llama and he had a broken
spine and I had to work for days together

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.599
to put his spine right, and they used a stick
to hit him.

00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:56.049
Can you imagine?

00:45:56.049 --> 00:45:58.260
Is it God?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:04.569
Is it religion?

00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:13.430
So Buddha and Mahavira, these two persons,
at that time did not talk of God, both of

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.430
them.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:58.630
Later on they again incarnated and talked
of God as Hassan and Hussein, as Kabira.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:24.170
And the illusion was that every time He turned
His feet the carpet turned with Him.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:33.250
They’re all one; we are only fighting because
we don’t see the oneness.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:39.680
So because of the time they did speak but
they did not cut out, they had to say, “Stop

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.660
at this point”, not more because that was
the situation.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660
You can see that.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660
All right?

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660
So it’s logical.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.089
Question: Do you have to do any practices
to raise the force?

00:47:51.089 --> 00:48:02.720
Shri Mataji: No, first of all I’d better
do it in a different way that you all get

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.309
your realization, first of all.

00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:10.900
Then of course, as I said, your Kundalini
attends to your problems.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:17.210
She goes down, so then I have to tell you
how to raise it, how to bring it back, how

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.230
to correct yourself.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:22.080
Once you’re established, you can do it to
others.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.070
So we can say it is in three parts.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:29.700
First is your establishment, like we can say
the sprouting of the seed.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.970
So that’s the awakening first of all or
realization as you touched.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.030
And then the second part you establish yourself.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:59.030
In the third part we establish others.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:08.010
All right?

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:35.809
Question: (repeated by Sahaja Yogi) Are You
speaking of Kundalini awakening?

00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:40.400
Others talk about it and then deliver the
goods, is this what You’re saying?

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400
Yes.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400
Shri Mataji: It’s true.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400
That’s true.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.210
Easy to talk about anything.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.849
It’s true when one need not talk.

00:49:47.849 --> 00:49:51.369
There’s no need to talk, it works silently.

00:49:51.369 --> 00:49:53.960
It is working in all of you.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.940
That’s the right approach, who delivers
the good.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.039
That’s right, he said the right thing.

00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:07.549
Who delivers the good?

00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:16.670
We can be satisfied with artificial things
you know, we can, we can be.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:36.910
Be careful on that point, you said the right
thing.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:42.569
Correct.

00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:54.770
Question: As a realized soul how can one help
social problems such as problems in Ethiopia

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.770
and so on?

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.990
Shri Mataji: Well very much.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:04.609
Now Ethiopia’s problem comes from two angles,
two angles.

00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:08.750
First is Ethiopia you know that the Rastafarians.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:13.390
Have you heard about them?

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:19.349
It comes from them; Rastafarians took to the
wrong side.

00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:23.810
In their religion itself you are supposed
to take the drugs and with taking drugs where

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.810
will you go?

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:29.990
Into your collective subconscious, and what
is in your collective subconscious is so injurious

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:32.680
that it can give you cancer.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.940
Cancer comes from the left side, which we
call as the collective subconscious.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.490
It can give all kinds of diseases, which cannot
be cured.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:47.970
Most of the incurable diseases come from there
and also the famine.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.599
The trees will burn.

00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:57.049
If you want to find out about a person if
it is true or not see the flower.

00:51:57.049 --> 00:52:03.400
Flower will just burn off, if there’s a
person who is possessed by the left side,

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.430
it will just burn off.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:12.250
The cows will not give milk, all things will
happen in the nature, and when there are so

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:19.400
many people who are doing this nonsensical
thing and having all the left sided movement

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:25.119
of their attention, they catch onto these
and that’s how the whole thing works on

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:26.420
their nature.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.619
That’s one thing.

00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:38.980
Now a realized soul if he goes to Ethiopia,
by his mere existence there, the nature may

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.980
change.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:46.329
If he is of a very evolved soul it will, even
with attention he can.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:50.180
Now the second point is, what is gone wrong?

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:57.799
You see this is what you say is the sin, the
sin, the wages of sin is fear, it’s much

00:52:57.799 --> 00:52:59.780
more than fear.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:06.900
It acts, this is a sin to go to these things
and succumb to collective subconscious.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:14.069
Instead of rising higher, keeping in the center,
going to the right and the left we can call

00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:17.990
it is the sin but in a very wider sense of
the word.

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.990
All right?

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:25.119
Now this is one thing that the country has
indulged too much into the left side will

00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:34.950
be grabbed, will be definitely grabbed into
the power of negative forces, no doubt about

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:35.950
it.

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:42.220
Their trees won’t grow, their flowers won’t
prosper, their children will die.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.580
They will have negative population, they will
have all problems of terrible diseases even

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.580
AIDS comes.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.580
AIDS also comes from the same area.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.580
It’s a very serious thing and when collectively
people start doing it, you just entering into

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:50.580
the satanic land where everything can work
out.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.630
That’s one thing, no use giving them money,
it’s very temporary.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:54:04.289
Easy money is the worst thing; you have to
give them something solid, something permanent,

00:54:04.289 --> 00:54:09.020
something eternal, something living, which
will make them grow.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.810
That’s one point.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:18.200
The second point of Ethiopia is a very collective
happening, which happened in Ethiopia.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:25.731
I met a minister by chance from Ethiopia who
was traveling with Me in the train and he

00:54:25.731 --> 00:54:32.270
told Me it was a political game.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:43.150
The politics which is not benevolent is no
politics at all, it’s a dirty game; and

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:50.109
when you go to the extremes you see the falsehood
is such a nonsense, such an ignorance, such

00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:56.010
a darkness that you start moving in it you
don’t know where you go till you reach your

00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:05.210
complete doom; and when you see that you don’t
understand what have we done, because to move

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:12.580
on a slope is the easiest and that’s how
Ethiopia has landed in trouble.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:21.529
Third point which comes to Me very important
that applies to all the nations, whether they

00:55:21.529 --> 00:55:27.960
are developing or developed, that we don’t
realize that we are part and parcel of one

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.810
world.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:34.430
God never created a separate world.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.110
It’s one world.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:40.329
Like one human being it has a heart, all right?

00:55:40.329 --> 00:55:46.599
It has a liver, it has everything but it’s
one and that we are all part and parcel of

00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:47.599
this.

00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:53.920
I would say that Roosevelt once said that
poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity

00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.549
everywhere, and when he said that I think
he understood the subtle thing.

00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:04.450
Anywhere in the body there is poverty, means
if there is any disease is a threat to the

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:06.470
whole body.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:17.529
But for that we are not yet there, we are
not grown up, we are still so insular, so

00:56:17.529 --> 00:56:18.529
insular.

00:56:18.529 --> 00:56:25.119
Like the other day we had a lady who was English,
I must say, she came, and in My house I have

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:31.130
- because my husband is international diplomat
traveling a lot - we have got things from

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:38.650
everywhere and she only appreciated English
things, invariably even without knowing.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:48.060
She couldn’t appreciate anything even if
for sixth century, second century she wouldn’t.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:55.230
So insular, we are all insular, everywhere,
whether it’s Indian, whether it’s English

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:59.700
whether it’s American, we are very insular
people, self-opinionated.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.900
We are not global.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:10.430
Unless and until we become global, problems
of the world cannot be solved.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:21.410
As if this finger of a leper is affected and
then there is no sensitivity in the whole

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:22.410
body.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:28.210
Then what happens that if a rat comes and
takes away the finger the leper doesn’t

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.210
know.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:34.160
So the lepers if you go to a leper home they’ll
say, “Just have the light for us to see”,

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:41.319
but this light when it comes within you see
that we are part and parcel of the whole and

00:57:41.319 --> 00:57:45.900
that’s how you grow up into the global personality.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:52.569
We are still English, British, Irish, Welsh.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:57.230
I was surprised even the Welsh won’t like
them to be called British.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:00.099
I mean it’s such a little land like that.

00:58:00.099 --> 00:58:06.970
Imagine in the heart if you have cells, which
do not call themselves cells of the heart,

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.650
what will happen to that heart?

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.210
It will collapse.

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:17.910
It is happening everywhere, it’s not only
in one country it’s the same as I said in

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.420
every country we are very insular people.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:25.849
We have to expand and how do we expand, how
do we expand?

00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:27.680
Through our Spirit.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.980
As you can see the characters of these people
they were global they never talked about one

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.089
country, two countries, three countries, they
talked for everyone.

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:48.789
This is the third big mistake, which all the
countries are doing and they are fighting,

00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:52.109
for what?

00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:55.330
Why are they all fighting, why are they having
wars?

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.580
God did not create wars, did He?

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.920
It’s not His mistake.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:07.250
This world belongs to Him and not to us.

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:20.320
All theories they become self-destructive
how can that be called as a benevolent politics?

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:36.960
In Sahaja Yoga we will have the politics of
Socrates, of giving and of not taking.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:44.109
But we have to have that race raised into
that personality that global personality.

00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:46.010
Can I do it alone?

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:59.660
You all have to help Me.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:16.340
Question: She’s no will power whatsoever,
She’s been a drug addict for 15 years, She

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.599
just wonder she can….

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:27.640
Shri Mataji: Don’t you worry, it’s all
there it will come back don’t you worry,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.049
all right?

01:00:29.049 --> 01:00:31.170
Don’t you worry.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:40.750
Love is the most powerful thing, we have never
used the power of love, don’t you worry.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:58.799
Question: I followed Swami Vivekananda for
years, advocated stern practices for years

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.130
and years ….

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:14.780
Shri Mataji: Now he is dead and gone, all
right [laughter…applause].

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.460
I’m sitting here; I’m your Mother, all
right?

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:26.099
I agree, I know, I know all that, all horrid
things forget it.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:30.040
I’m your Mother, all right?

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.450
If I can work it out only with My love, why
should you worry about Vivekananda?

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:38.289
It’s all right, forget it, that’s over.

01:01:38.289 --> 01:01:39.940
You have done it in previous life.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.530
Vivekananda had to do it in this life but
you have done it before, all right?

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.460
You all have finished with it, now you just
get your prizes.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:55.170
[Shri Mataji and everyone laughs]You don’t
have 

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.329
to do anything like that.

01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:06.529
You see a person who has to cook who has never
cooked before has to go through all rigmarole.

01:02:06.529 --> 01:02:08.119
But supposing your Mother knows cooking.

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:09.349
She’s done the cooking.

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:11.720
Come along and have the food, finished.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.750
Why to worry?

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.930
All right?

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:22.049
It’s already made.

01:02:22.049 --> 01:02:24.279
You are a seeker, you have been a seeker.

01:02:24.279 --> 01:02:30.369
You have done all that many lives, you’ve
been to Himalayas so now forget it, forget

01:02:30.369 --> 01:02:31.390
it.

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:34.270
Better have it, all right?

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:39.240
There are so many here I can see that kind.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.339
Question: Can we have the food that You’ve
prepared?

01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:48.670
Shri Mataji: You’re hungry, that’s great.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.630
Let’s have it, all right?

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:51.630
Should we?

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:57.349
Now do not analyze anymore, just have it,
don’t analyze, when you’re hungry you

01:02:57.349 --> 01:03:02.299
don’t analyze from where did you get it,
what has happened, how (will) you cook it.

01:03:02.299 --> 01:03:03.480
You just see the fun, that’s all.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.440
You just enjoy it, that’s a good idea.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:22.970
Question: After you die, would you like to
go to heaven or do you wish to stay around?

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:26.650
Shri Mataji: Who I?

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:28.369
I die?

01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:31.460
I think of the present never of the future.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:37.741
You be in the present, don’t worry about
the future.

01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:43.220
We should worry about the present, that’s
why you see Buddha talked about the Self.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.269
Why talk of the future?

01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:47.819
Doesn’t exist for Me.

01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:51.640
Question: Present and future bind together

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:58.180
Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes but you become first
the present, otherwise there’s no binding.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.190
Either you are in the future or in the past,
first of all become the present.

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:07.740
There’s no binding, that’s the chain is
missing, that’s why I’m saying become

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.740
the present.

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.339
All right?

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:24.200
Question: I want to know the answer, are You
going to stay around or are You going to go

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.069
to heaven when You die?

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:44.570
Shri Mataji: I’m already in heaven (laughter…
applause) would you like to join Me?

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.690
You please join Me in heaven, all right?

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:49.930
I’m already in heaven.

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:56.980
I see the heaven around Me everywhere, only
thing you have to enter into that subtle thing.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:02.079
It’s so beautiful; it’s so beautiful.

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:18.310
All right, now you don’t have to do much,
but as I said we have problems within ourselves.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:25.170
We have to little bit work out ourselves,
our awakening and doing so you will know also

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:28.460
later on if the Kundalini falls off how to
raise it.

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.940
It’s very simple, not much.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:38.230
You have to use your left and right hand because
as Mohamed Sahib has said that at the time

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:43.740
of resurrection your hands will speak, in
the sense that you get your collective consciousness

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.849
and your fingertips become enlightened.

01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:52.430
So as all the doctors will also say that we
have a sympathetic nervous system acting on

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:53.970
our fingertips.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:06:02.079
Now when you put the left hand towards Me,
it represents your desire to be self realized.

01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:07.029
So just you have to put your left hand like
this nothing else is to be done - simple,

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.690
but in a humble way.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:16.410
If you say, “now give me realization”,
all right, but we have to be humble.

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:17.700
That’s very important.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:23.670
When we are humble, we are peaceful and the
thing works out faster.

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:26.550
So do not analyze it just get it.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:29.829
It’s simple how to eat the food I’m just
telling you.

01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:32.309
Put your left hand straight like this.

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:37.670
First of all it’s better to take the advantage
of Mother Earth so you have to take out your

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:38.670
shoes.

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:41.260
You can keep your socks but better to take
out your shoes, because sometimes they can

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:48.599
be very tight and your hats.

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:57.130
Anything tight, which makes you uncomfortable,
should be loosened, that’s all.

01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:02.310
Now, just put your left hand straight like
this.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:07.730
Everyone should try to do it, it’s very
simple, it’s not going to take much time,

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:09.570
it’s very simple.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:16.270
Nothing is going to happen to you but, on
the contrary, you will become at least ten

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:20.279
years younger, that’s a promise.

01:07:20.279 --> 01:07:25.160
You see a mother when she gives castor oil,
also she has to cover it with some chocolates.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:31.040
So now this is one of the temptations for
many people must be, but there are so many

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.960
other things that I cannot describe in this
short lecture.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.200
So I would say that just put your left hand
because this is your own power within you,

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.510
which you do not know, just put your left
hand just like this.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:47.829
All of you please put your left hand on your
lap very comfortably.

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:52.970
Now your right hand is the one, which is the
power of action.

01:07:52.970 --> 01:08:03.019
With this you act, so you have to use your
right hand just first on your heart centre

01:08:03.019 --> 01:08:06.309
then because in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:10.890
Then I’ll tell you one by one, but just
now can see on the upper part of the stomach,

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:17.799
in the lower part of the stomach, then again
in the upper part of the stomach, then on

01:08:17.799 --> 01:08:24.390
the heart, then here, then here, then here.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:30.719
I will tell you one by one everywhere and
then on top of your head here, stretch your

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:35.540
hand palm, put it down there and press it
hard, that’s all.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.540
It’s very simple.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:42.089
Now this all has to be done with the right
hand, just remember this one point and left

01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:43.089
hand here.

01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:44.719
What are these centers?

01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:46.600
I will tell you.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.580
One by one, you need not remember.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:54.230
It’s all in the book, but just now you know
that it is to be worked out on the left-hand

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:55.230
side.

01:08:55.230 --> 01:09:01.719
Because left-hand side is our desire and we
are putting our hand of our desire.

01:09:01.719 --> 01:09:08.319
Now the left hand is already quite heavy I
must say, all right, so now.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:16.670
You put your left hand just like this and
at the very outset, as I’ve told in every

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:23.630
Western program, you have to forgive yourself.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:35.270
You’re not to feel guilty for anything whatsoever
even for reading Vivekananda.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:40.400
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself;
after all you are the temple of God.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:48.960
So don’t despise yourself, don’t think
low of yourself, forgive yourself and say

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.130
with full confidence that you’re not guilty.

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:58.160
This is a fashion also, everybody wants to
say “I’m guilty.”

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.510
It’s a fashion, it’s just a fashion.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:08.460
So please don’t consider yourself guilty
for anything you have done in the past what

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.890
you think of the future.

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:19.480
Let your present come up and then you will
know that all these were mythical ideas.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.630
The truth has to come.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:25.440
So now you have to close your eyes.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.139
Don’t open your eyes.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:31.480
There’s no mesmerism going on, so no need
to keep the eyes open.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:37.710
But in any case keep your eyes shut till I
tell you to open, because when the Kundalini

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.110
is rising it’s better to keep your attention
inside.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:46.910
At least through the eyes the attention goes
out, so if you keep your eyes closed the Kundalini

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:50.210
rises much better.

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:55.340
Sometimes She does not rise if your attention
is out, so I know attention cannot be inside,

01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:01.320
but when you close your eyes at least it is
not going out too much.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:07.760
So the Kundalini rises and It sucks in all
your attention, like I can say in My sari

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.989
if I have the Kundalini rising like that it
sucks in the sari like the attention, In the

01:11:12.989 --> 01:11:17.190
same way it goes up and ultimately pierces
through here.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:22.100
It should happen, you all should certify yourself,
nobody needs certify you.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.110
Once you say you are feeling the cool breeze
then you can ask somebody to see you.

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:31.040
If you are not feeling it, don’t get desperate,
you all can feel it.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.850
There are so many here sitting and I’m sure
you can be told and helped.

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:39.260
And then once you get it, you have to help
others.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:44.860
That’s how we are going to work it out.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:53.610
So now please put left hand like this, right
hand on your heart.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:12:00.380
Now here close your eyes.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:11.090
In the heart resides the Spirit, so please
ask Me three times a question in your heart,

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.320
not loudly.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.850
Please ask Me sincerely a question.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:25.460
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can
call Me “Mother”, whatever you like.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.290
“Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:31.110
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.480
Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.489
Now this is a fundamental question you’re
asking to a computer, which has to give you

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:58.800
the answer.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:22.670
Now this question is followed by another question
when you put your right hand in the upper

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:26.110
part of your stomach on the left-hand side.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:30.030
You’re working everything on the left-hand
side and press it hard.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:40.790
Now here is the centre, which gives you the
power of mastery over yourself, the mastery

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:47.159
over the divine knowledge, the mastery over
the working of the divine knowledge.

01:13:47.159 --> 01:13:52.690
That means you become your own master, you
become your own guru, nobody can dominate

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:58.500
you, nothing can dominate you, no habits can
dominate you.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:05.530
So at this point you press your fingers dig
them down here you have to ask the second

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:11.219
question to me, Mother am I my own master?

01:14:11.219 --> 01:14:18.710
Ask this questions three times please, with
full faith in yourself ask this question:

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:20.639
“Mother, am I my own master?

01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:24.510
“ This will neutralize all your useless
feelings and everything.

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:50.050
“Mother am I my own master?”

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:58.969
Now please take your hand down in the lower
part of your abdomen and press it hard there

01:14:58.969 --> 01:15:03.110
on the left-hand side, keep the left hand
towards me.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:15.690
Now here is the centre, which is working out
the divine technique, the pure knowledge,

01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:22.929
the true art of this technique is worked out
through this centre here.

01:15:22.929 --> 01:15:34.860
At this centre I cannot force you in any way
that you should ask me for your self-realization.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:43.840
It should be your own desire free will ask
for it.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:57.830
So here you please ask Me, “Mother, may
I have the true knowledge?”

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:02.770
This has to be said six times because there
are six petals to this center.

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:14.570
“Mother, may I have the true knowledge,
the pure knowledge of the divine technique?”

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.469
(Why don’t you do?

01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:23.270
You’re so young, please try, it’s very
easy.

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:26.469
For young people to be that adamant is not
good.

01:16:26.469 --> 01:16:34.680
But please try, it’s worth it.)

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.080
Six times please.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:17:28.760
You must learn to listen and sometimes understand,
all right?

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.989
Now raise this hand again on the left-hand
side, on the same center of the principle

01:17:34.989 --> 01:17:44.170
of the mastery on the upper part of your abdomen
of your stomach, on the left-hand side, And

01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:47.449
now press it hard.

01:17:47.449 --> 01:17:58.150
This center has got ten petals, so here now
you have to help your Kundalini to rise by

01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:08.659
asserting the truth, by saying ten times with
full confidence in yourself, “Mother I am

01:18:08.659 --> 01:18:10.690
my master.

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:14.420
Mother I am my own master.

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.560
Mother I am my own master.”

01:18:16.560 --> 01:19:01.760
Please say it ten times.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:10.760
Now again you raise your hand on top of your
heart and put it there with full confidence

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:18.540
here, as this centre has got twelve petals
you have to say with full confidence in yourself

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.699
the truth, “Mother I am the Sprit.”

01:19:21.699 --> 01:19:28.190
You are the Spirit, so please say with full
confidence, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:59.389
Believe Me, you are the Spirit.

01:19:59.389 --> 01:20:19.889
Twelve times.

01:20:19.889 --> 01:20:28.969
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of God’s love.

01:20:28.969 --> 01:20:36.560
It is the ocean of His forgiveness and you
cannot do anything that He cannot forgive.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:42.300
He’s that powerful, His forgiveness is that
powerful, so there’s no need for you to

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:55.429
feel guilty about anything whatsoever, by
that you’re challenging His power of forgiveness.

01:20:55.429 --> 01:21:11.119
So now you raise your hand in the angle of
your neck and your shoulder and push it back

01:21:11.119 --> 01:21:14.030
towards the spinal chord and press it very
hard.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:17.250
Now this is the most difficult center in the
West.

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:22.469
As I said, when you feel guilty you catch
this center and you get all kinds of troubles

01:21:22.469 --> 01:21:31.150
like angina also troubles like spondylitis
and so many other problems.

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:42.090
Now press it hard and with full confidence,
you say sixteen times, “Mother I’m not

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:46.270
guilty.”

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:47.740
Sixteen times.

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:55.820
You have to be pleasant with yourself; you
have to cherish yourself and not to condemn

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.610
yourself at all by any chance.

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:03.320
You are not guilty.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.710
So please say, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all” sixteen times.

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:14.260
But those who still want to go ahead with
it punish themselves by saying it 108 times.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.260
That would be the best.

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:20.550
(Shri Mataji blowing on her hand and rubbing
Her hands) So much heat coming out from there,

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:22.480
so much of heat.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:30.360
“I’m not guilty.”

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.820
Put your left hand towards Me, say with full
confidence.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:42.320
Wow, this is the worst hurdle, I tell you.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:51.070
It’s just a myth; it’s a conception in
your head that you’re guilty.

01:22:51.070 --> 01:23:00.100
What guilt can you have that cannot be washed
by the great power of God’s love and forgiveness?

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:11.440
(Shri Mataji is rubbing Her hands) Sixteen
times or 108 times.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.420
You do not know how to love yourself.

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:16.320
You’re supposed to be selfish but there’s
no selfishness I think.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:59.790
(Shri Mataji is blowing hard and rubbing Her
hands)

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:10.139
Now raise this hand on your forehead across
and press it on both the sides.

01:24:10.139 --> 01:24:17.670
Now, here is the center where you have to
forgive others.

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:25.290
I will not say how many times but from your
heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:29.449
I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone.”

01:24:29.449 --> 01:24:36.210
Now maybe you might say it’s very difficult,
but it’s not all because it is mythical.

01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:39.250
What do you do by not forgiving or forgiving?

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:44.650
Is nothing, but when you don’t forgive you
play into the hands of wrong people.

01:24:44.650 --> 01:24:50.400
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,
everyone I forgive.”

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.620
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given
us - to forgive.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:58.510
Forgive everyone, forgive everyone, forgive
everyone.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:21.850
Now for 

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:30.400
your own satisfaction you may put your hand
on the backside of your head, backside of

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.860
your head.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:41.699
Here is the center where you have to say that
“If I have done anything wrong against the

01:25:41.699 --> 01:25:43.340
Divine, please forgive me.”

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:51.630
You have to ask the Divine the forgiveness,
so that there’s no doubt in your mind or

01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:55.020
sort of lurking guilt.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:10.100
Say that three times of from your heart it
will work out, but don’t count the mistakes,

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.180
so called.

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.290
Just say that, saying is sufficient.

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:21.489
Saying is the enlightened chanting, all right?

01:26:21.489 --> 01:26:30.570
Now stretch your hand put it on top of your
head, bend you head a little bit forward.

01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:43.670
On top of your head, bend it and now rub it
hard the scalp seven times.

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:50.000
Here again I cannot cross your freedom, so
you have to say, “Mother, I want my Realization.”

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.489
I cannot force it on you, so just say, “I
want my Realization.”

01:26:53.489 --> 01:26:56.850
I can only persuade you, but I cannot force
it.

01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.480
You have to ask for it.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:04.500
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
may I have my realization?

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:14.469
Please give me my Realization” seven times.

01:27:14.469 --> 01:27:37.850
(Shri Mataji blows seven times into the microphone)

01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:47.340
Now bring down your right hand, put it towards
Me.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:57.050
Slowly open your eyes and put your left hand
bending your head a little bit on top of your

01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:02.179
head here, little higher and see if there’s
a cool breeze coming out.

01:28:02.179 --> 01:28:07.390
With the left hand you see, not with the right,
right hand towards Me, the right hand towards

01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:13.619
Me, the left hand just try to see if you’re
feeling any cool breeze out of your head,

01:28:13.619 --> 01:28:15.460
all right?

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:18.210
Don’t get upset.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:27.380
If you’re not feeling doesn’t matter,
we’ll work it out.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:29.219
Doesn’t matter.

01:28:29.219 --> 01:28:35.550
Now turn it round again put it here the right
hand, see with the right hand if you’re

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:36.640
feeling the cool breeze.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.600
Some people don’t feel it, doesn’t matter.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.070
Nothing so desperately bad.

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:55.139
There is, I can see that.

01:28:55.139 --> 01:29:14.830
Now left hand again, little higher, maybe
little higher, some people feel it very high

01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:20.929
you see, it shoots off, just see.

01:29:20.929 --> 01:29:26.830
Now you may put your hand up towards the sky
and ask the question, “Is this the All-Pervading

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:28.790
Power of God’s love?

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:32.199
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:29:32.199 --> 01:29:35.239
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

01:29:35.239 --> 01:29:41.580
Ask the question three times.

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:57.060
Now, such a lot, all the Sahaja Yogis sitting
here.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.050
Are you feeling?

01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:00.380
Cool breeze?

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.710
Or what?

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:02.710
Something happening?

01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:08.140
Now put back your hand, now don’t analyze
it just see in the hands are you feeling any

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.239
cool breeze in the hands.

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:22.980
All right, little bit, some feel a little
bit; but it’s all right, the beginning has

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.440
started.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:31.590
Now most of you have got the right hands less,
so put the right hand towards Me, left hand

01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:34.820
like this towards the sky, it will ventilate.

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:51.180
Left hand like this and now forgive, forgive
everyone, everyone you forgive, just forgive.

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.050
That’s the mantra.

01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:58.590
It will release, left hand up.

01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:02.210
Right hand towards Me and left hand up.

01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:06.540
Now right hand towards Me.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.562
Moving, is it?

01:31:08.562 --> 01:31:19.630
Slowly, slowly it will move, right hand is
difficult because mostly we are very right-sided

01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:22.610
people, mostly.

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:25.590
Yes, good.

01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:32.961
Now with the left hand you put towards Me
and right hand towards the Mother Earth like

01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:35.370
this.

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:38.940
Left hand towards Me and right hand towards
the Mother earth.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:45.380
This is what we are doing: we are correcting
the elements within us, bringing them into

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:46.570
balance.

01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:50.950
Which you will know very soon what it was,
what we were doing.

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:52.199
You’ll know everything.

01:31:52.199 --> 01:31:58.660
No, no left towards Me, left towards Me and
right towards the Mother Earth.

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.810
Right towards the Mother Earth.

01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:03.980
Left towards Me, right towards the Mother
Earth.

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:07.180
Mmm, better.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.380
All right?

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:39.159
Now all those who have felt the cool breeze
in the head or in the hands raise your both

01:32:39.159 --> 01:32:47.140
the hands.

01:32:47.140 --> 01:33:33.540
All 

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:44.429
of you?

01:33:44.429 --> 01:33:55.199
Practically?

01:33:55.199 --> 01:33:58.690
The sprouting has started.

01:33:58.690 --> 01:43:47.689
May God bless you.

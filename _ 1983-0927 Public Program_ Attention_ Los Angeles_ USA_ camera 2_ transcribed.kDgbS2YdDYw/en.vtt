00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:37.680
Dr. Warren has already talked to you 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.860
about the different centers that we have within
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:56.390
they are placed and how gradually when the
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:05.350
core of the centers.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:17.510
There are three channels in the central channel,
and the innermost channel is used by Kundalini

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.640
to pierce through for the first time.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:35.101
You can imagine Kundalini to be made of many
strands of energy tied together just like

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:50.430
a rope, and as the chakras start opening more
strands start getting awakened and they pierce

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:02.160
through these six centers; but if a person
after Realization just thinks that he has

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.530
got the Realization, then he doesn't have
to bother about it, may lose it for the time

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.950
being, for quite some time I should say, and
he'll have to work much harder to re-establish

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.799
his Self Realization.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:29.170
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, “Yes, we have felt it.”

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:39.130
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.600
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:57.859
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.109
from them how to establish your Realization.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.040
That is a very, very important time which
must be taken into consideration.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:18.389
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:30.169
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.500
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.300
So I asked her, “How is it that you are
cured of cancer, now you get another disease?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.790
Did you do anything about it?”

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.199
“No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, ‘You are looking very fine.’

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.720
They are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.840
anything about it.”

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.180
So she got another trouble.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.720
You go on like this, you cure one thing then
you again cure another thing.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.169
Like little children, you clean them, then
again they get out and soil their clothes,

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.750
again they are back in the bathroom, then
again you clean them, again they do the same

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.750
thing.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.650
So you have to mature, after Realization you
must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.280
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:46.180
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.610
at all.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.409
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.650
have to become a little serious person about
it.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.960
Shallow temperament is not going to help you,
or looking at it as if like another guru shopping

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.180
business it is not going to work out.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.960
You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.729
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.970
people, giving them Realization.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:29.219
There is no need then for you to bother that
you will catch from others, or anything; but

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.229
before that you should not try to help others.

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.159
First help yourself, selfishness to begin
with.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:43.710
Unless and until you are all right and you
know all the methods of protecting yourself,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:53.120
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices
which helps others.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.530
But when you become an expert, when you have
an expertise then you should do it.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.629
Like a mechanic who doesn’t know how to
repair a car, they spoil it more.

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.490
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.759
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:22.680
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.520
You will be surprised you won't be aware of
problems that you have.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.639
One gentleman came and told Me, “Mother
everyone is coming and asking me, ‘what

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.069
about your father, what's the problem?’”

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:37.629
I said, “Everybody said the same?”

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:38.949
He said, “Yes.”

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:41.439
I said, “I also want to know, what about
your father?”

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:47.759
He said, “My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father.”

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:54.770
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.159
one thing that is the truth about you.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:03.020
All of them will say the same thing, even
if it is a small child, he will also come

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.770
and ask you that “Is your father all right?”

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.439
Because if he knows that this center, this
center on the right hand side means the father.

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:19.389
So he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, “what about your father?”

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:27.180
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.569
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:39.729
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center.

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:50.350
At the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:56.890
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:03.850
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.070
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:18.160
One of them is that such a person is full
of fragrance, such a person has a tremendous

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:29.529
gravity, tremendous gravity, and such a person
has tremendous dynamism, and attraction is

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:34.370
a bad word so I don't want to use it, but
magnetical.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:43.380
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:51.431
Such a person develops a tremendous sense
of roots and sense of direction, you place

00:09:51.431 --> 00:09:53.750
him anywhere he will know where to go.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.339
Like birds, you place birds anywhere they
know which side is north, south, east, west.

00:09:59.339 --> 00:10:09.011
In the same way you also develop your lost
innocence and your magnet within you by which

00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:16.230
you have proper direction; but the highest
of all you develop the proper direction to

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.910
wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:26.610
You just don't do stupid things, you just
don't do, even if you ever try to do it, you

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:32.170
will not do it, because you know it is so
stupid, just you don't do it.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:40.250
I mean it is so simple to be wise than to
be stupid, because if you have to be stupid

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:48.240
you have to go out of the way to be stupid
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.610
and wise is the easiest thing to do.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:11:00.399
But what people do is to do things that would
make them more and more stupid, nonsensical,

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:09.029
because also some people told Me they do it,
the reason being they think they have a nuisance

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:10.029
value.

00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:14.430
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.430
“Punk rock.”

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.389
You see, it's a funny stuff.

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:23.630
Now poor kids they don't know what they are
doing it, and I think the only value of that

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:34.570
punk rock system is this: that they try to
sort of make a nuisance out of them so that

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.480
people feel attracted towards them or sort
of a significance out of them.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:46.389
But when you become a realized soul you realize
your significance, because you understand

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:54.160
you are part and parcel of the whole and that
your significance is to give Realization to

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.649
others, the highest of highest, that's what
you have to do now you are a saint, and that’s

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:10.269
how the whole attitude of cheapiness, of outward
shallowness finishes and you become a serene,

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:11.370
dignified personality.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:18.959
This is not possible through any sermon, any
lecture, it's only possible when the Kundalini

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:27.000
rises you become like a very dignified child,
very dignified child.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.770
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:42.210
You see Her as a child, She is a very dignified
personality, as a child, She is about ten

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.269
years of age.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:49.640
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.899
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:58.149
In every behavior you find there's such a
dignity, they'll never do something shallow,

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:02.670
they never ask for anything, they never weep
for anything, they never cry for anything,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.079
they are so dignified and they understand
it so well what is dignity is.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:14.230
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.680
nobody has to tell you that “do this, or
do that,” but you understand that you must

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.220
have self-respect.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.690
This happens to you automatically, this is
actualization, nobody has to tell you that

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.279
“you be dignified,” you just become.

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:33.560
I've seen people who were absolutely absurd,
even from this punk rock we got some people

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.360
and they were so changed that people could
not recognize them, but one thing bad has

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.509
happened with this punk rock that they put
some sort of dye in their head and since then

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:52.220
their eyes became very weak, because these
dyes I think made the optic globe covered

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.060
with some sort of a color and you can't see
properly, and the eyes became very weak and

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:04.220
it took some time for us to remove the effect
of those dyes from their head.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.370
We go headlong, “what's wrong?”

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:12.279
There is nothing wrong in this world if it
is a stupid fool, but for a wise man there

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:17.889
are very many things which are absolutely
wrong, and there are very many things which

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:24.170
are absolutely correct, so you develop your
wisdom by this first center.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:31.730
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.920
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.410
But second center, you become extremely creative,
extremely creative.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:46.009
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had
no job.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:48.649
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and
what should I do?”

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:51.230
I said, “All right, what do you want to
do?”

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.850
He said, “Whatever you say.”

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.560
I said, “All right, why don't you become
an interior decorator?”

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.399
He said, “Me?

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.949
I don't know what is a teak wood, I don’t
know what is a rose wood, how am I to become

00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:03.949
an interior decorator?”

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:06.360
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.480
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:20.009
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:26.160
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.250
educated in art, how you can do it.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:34.670
I went to Japan once, and they were having
an Ikebana competition or something, so I

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.569
went to see the Ikebana class and they requested
Me, “Why don't you do some flower arrangements?”

00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:41.690
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:48.069
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:50.600
Me, I got the highest mark.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.550
I can do lots of things which I've never done
before like architecture.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.879
I have built houses without doing any architecture,
I've done decorations of the houses, I've

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:08.120
done all kinds of things without knowing how
to it, because you become you so creative.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.480
Music you start understanding so much better.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.779
There are people now in America, there's a
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:20.560
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out
of tune.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.160
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs
before Me because it’s rather funny.”

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.279
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me
a good voice?”

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:32.279
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.389
be all right.”

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:40.740
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you
sit down.]

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:47.170
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:52.760
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:17:00.430
So the creativity, that also is a blessing
of your power of the Goddess of learning.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.130
Boys who could not study in the schools were
absolutely duffers.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.780
Some people brought this boy, recently I’ve
received a letter from him.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.560
When he came to Me, his father said that “He
is going to be taken out of school because

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.550
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished.”

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.140
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let
him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.400
He got his Realization.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.360
Not only that he passed with first class,
but he got a scholarship.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.830
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.080
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young
age.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.960
He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can believe
that a duffer like me has been so much highly

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.140
placed.”

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:50.420
All the boys who got scholarships in Maharashtra
in schools, in colleges and universities are

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.850
Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:58.440
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:10.940
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:19.690
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.150
is so good and it lasts you so longer.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:30.981
Like one gentleman tried, a university professor
in agricultural college on some wheat, some

00:18:30.981 --> 00:18:37.120
vibrations and he was amazed that when they
collected this wheat it was at least six times

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:45.340
more than normal, and when this wheat was
stored in a big hall like this, there were

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:53.450
so many other things, the rats who are always
a menace in India never touched that wheat.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.100
They ate all the rest of it but never touched
the wheat.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:05.550
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:11.070
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.270
They'll never touch you, they will never trouble
you.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.900
Even a tiger sees a saint, he never attacks.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.040
You can handle a tiger very easily; this is
the power of a saint.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.630
So you develop a tremendous capacity of creativity.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:33.310
The greatest capacity you have then is of
creating a new human being out of a ordinary

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.310
human being.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:41.670
This is the greatest blessing that you have,
that you transform an egg into a bird and

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:47.380
that is the epitome, that is the spiritual
power you have, by which you can transform

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:57.320
the whole human race into a new race which
has this fifth dimension within yourself.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.630
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.170
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.690
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.690
amazed.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.980
He said, “Mother, how do you know all these
things?”

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.270
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I
know.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.030
That’s what it is, you just have a look
at this.”

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.970
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.110
He said that “For this I had to study so
much.”

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.060
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study.”

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.620
A little bit you know and immediately you
click the point.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.880
Now this is the second thing that you know
in your learnings, in your education you are

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.170
all right, but the mastery of this center
comes, the mastery of this center comes when

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:54.470
you know the pure knowledge, the pure knowledge
of handling the Kundalini, the pure knowledge

00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:00.840
of Spirit, the pure knowledge of the blessings
of God, of Ritambhara Pragya.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:07.770
If you know that, that is the highest that
you achieve gradually as you grow, because

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:14.740
when these centers starts expanding on the
sides, you start expanding in your personality,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.820
in your sensitivity and in your evolutionary
ascent, so that is how you start growing from

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.710
one to another to another to another.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:31.460
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:39.020
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.730
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:50.270
Your compete priorities change, complete priorities
change, because the joy that you get out of

00:21:50.270 --> 00:22:00.000
Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out of this meditation,
out of the feeling that grows in you all the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.830
time, like a beautiful torrential rain of
joy that fills you, your life and everybody's

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:15.280
life, you don't care for cheap type of entertainment.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:21.140
You feel, you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you
want to meet another Sahaja Yogi, you don't

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.370
want to meet anybody else.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.650
If there is an actor coming, or some big man
is coming, “All right, let him come, I'm

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.410
going to see such and such person.”

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:36.140
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.280
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.910
to Sicily.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.590
And she was eating her food, suddenly she
felt there is some vibrations coming down,

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:53.020
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, “Are you Mataji's

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.020
disciple?”

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.940
And she said, “Yes, I am Mataji's child.”

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.360
They both got up and just hugged and said,
“Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.790
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.800
And then they stayed together and they wouldn’t
go anywhere else but they said, “Now this

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800
is the enjoyment.”

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.350
Just the company of a Sahaja Yogi is such
an enjoyment.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.100
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.090
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:32.370
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:38.780
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.570
time they start enjoying.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.990
We were once in a hotel staying in Calcutta
and with two Sahaja Yogi with Me.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:51.540
They were in the other room, quite far away,
they could not get a room close to Me, and

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.640
one gentleman came for his Realization, he
came to My feet, when he got his Realization

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.750
it was a tremendous happening and they came
rushing from there.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.120
I said, “What happened?”

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.121
They said, “We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

00:24:07.121 --> 00:24:09.490
come to receive the vibrations.”

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.380
And they came and they felt the vibrations.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:18.850
So this man was so great that his vibrations
attracted them and they came down.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.870
They were just enjoying that as if they were
enjoying a big flower with lots of fragrance.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.940
What vibrations, what vibrations!

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.510
The fellow got up and said, “Very nice.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.000
They are enjoying my vibrations.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.480
Now I'm going to enjoy your vibrations.”

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:43.090
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:51.380
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.650
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.950
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.660
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.710
The other day I had a lady who came to see
Me, and she was trying to put her point and

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:15.890
there were about five-six Sahaja Yogis, and
everybody was putting the same point and she

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.890
was amazed.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:22.700
She said, “I've never seen such concord,
such friendship, such understanding, all of

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.980
them supporting each other, nobody is cutting
anyone.”

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.930
Such a society has to develop.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:37.960
It’s such a nourishing, soothing, invigorating
society, and you forget about getting bored,

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:44.300
boredom goes out of life, you never get bored,
you enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:50.970
of Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level
that you come of - that is what, that land

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.610
you have to reach within yourself.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:26:01.020
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.670
other seekers, you try to find out “where
is the seeker?”

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.850
If you hear somebody is a seeker, you go and
see.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:15.780
If you hear about someone that some people
are lost there, they were seekers, but they

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.310
went there lost, you all rush there.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:25.730
It is like a person who is like a, what you
call a guard on the seashore you know, there

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.420
are guards kept for salvaging people, and
that is how you become.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.240
You suddenly see somebody sinking, you just
go.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.700
In Bombay there was a case they announce that
“there’s a lady who is going to die, if

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.290
somebody can come and help her, it will be
a great thing.”

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.850
They all rushed there; they saved her.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:51.010
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:56.540
that you are helping them, not at all.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:02.100
But the surrounding portion of that, which
is the void, is the best, which is affected

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:08.810
by your awakening, that you become the virtue
itself.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:16.710
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous,
when you are awakened you become a virtuous

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:27.670
person, you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy
being good, you enjoy being nice, you really

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.120
enjoy it.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:35.690
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:47.941
so powerful that anyone who is harmed or troubled
or tortured or put down, you stand up, you

00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:53.100
are not afraid of anyone, you are not afraid
of any one of them.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:00.550
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:07.320
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.180
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.120
person who could be really genuine.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:24.000
It was the problem that time, but with this
awakening within you of the virtuous nature,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.340
you just know what is virtue and what is not
virtue.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.880
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.”

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:38.551
I never say that, it just happens, because
when the virtue starts developing, the vibrations

00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:42.270
improve and you feel extremely joyous.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:52.110
We have lost our virtues because there is
no joy out of it, no reward.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.790
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:04.820
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.820
virtues.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.900
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising, like once there was a lady

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.020
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.420
So I said, “All right come and stay with
Me.”

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.340
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this?

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.920
You don't know her, who she is, her husband,
whether he is her husband or not, just given

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.920
her two rooms.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.920
It's not good!”

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.270
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.330
I know for nothing is going to happen, let
her be here.”

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.580
So they wouldn't also go against Me.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.850
They said, “All right, if you say so.”

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.410
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.480
Then she become a very well-known actress
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.860
but somebody told Me that she is the same
lady.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.860
I said, “Maybe.”

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:51.130
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.580
“We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress.”

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.910
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.910
no choice.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.150
I will not go and see her.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.150
You just ask her.”

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.580
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.580
She said, “I'll try.”

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.580
This, that she was saying.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.250
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.090
was so amazed, she said, “Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.880
this, Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!”

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.210
She just came forward, she said, “Have anything
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.720
that you never told me that She's there.”

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.340
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:38.620
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.270
your friends in this world.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.770
Your have to just tell you are coming, there
will hundred people at the airport to receive

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.770
you.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.460
There will be so many friends all over the
world for you, you will be amazed.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:55.130
It's such a tremendous thing happens, because
now you all are awakened in that Primordial

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.350
Being and you have become one with each other.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.590
You can feel it, that oneness, that unison
that we are all not only human beings but

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:08.230
we are yogis, we are super human beings, and
we have to look after the whole world.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:15.971
That feeling of compassion is so overwhelming
that all little, little stupid things just

00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:19.780
fall off, there's no place for that.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.880
This actually happens and has happened with
many.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.390
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:33.190
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.230
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, “How are they going to be all

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.230
right?”

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.430
But today I find them as great friends and
very great yogis.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:47.590
So this is the center where your religion
is awakened.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.590
And what is a religion?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:52.770
Word comes from “religo,” in Sanskrit
it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa Dharma,”

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.450
the sustenance, your sustenance, your valances
is your religion.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:03.200
As every atom, carbon has four valances, and
in the same way you have ten valances, these

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:11.250
are the ten commandments that were told to
you and you become that, you just become.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:16.810
I don't have to tell you as commandments but
they become your beautiful ornaments within

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.200
yourself.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.020
This happens automatically, so spontaneously
you become that.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.090
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:34.070
He came to see Me, and he was rather adamant
and little angry when he came to see Me because

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.080
he thought, “Why am I trying to do this
kind of thing?”

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.500
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.840
lectures in the church for years together,
but I could not achieve anything.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.600
How have You transformed these people?

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.310
The drug addicts have suddenly become such
good people that they have given up drugs,

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.850
alcoholics have given up alcohol.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.340
How is it without telling them anything?”

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.370
I said, “Everything is within them.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.450
As soon as the light comes you can see everything.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.820
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.500
you just give up.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.570
Only thing you have to have the light within
you.”

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:20.280
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, “Really, that should be done, is

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.340
to transform them.”

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.230
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:30.940
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism.”

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:37.080
And I must say that Calvinist, of all the
persons, Calvinist in Geneva have accepted

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.170
Me and they think that this is the only way
they can transform you.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:48.280
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:56.000
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.680
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.040
We'll see one day that this is the way it
has to be.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.960
God has given us this power, we have got a
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.870
that and we should accept it, not because
I'm doing it, you can do it also.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:18.869
So this thing happens to you with this chakra.

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:23.850
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:30.020
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.210
breast cancer and all that.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:39.941
But when it is awakened, you get all the security
of the world, you are never insecure, you

00:34:39.941 --> 00:34:46.570
are never bothered, you have no fear of anyone.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.589
You do not have to suggest yourself that “you
should not have fear or anything,” you just

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:58.390
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.390
anything.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:05.609
Like the gentleman who came here, just to
beat Me now, I was just looking at the drum,

00:35:05.609 --> 00:35:08.529
and the fellow was getting frightened of Me,
he was going backwards, backwards, he would

00:35:08.529 --> 00:35:10.150
not come forward.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:15.839
But you don't develop any fear of at all about
anyone, because you are standing on truth,

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:16.839
like Christ.

00:35:16.839 --> 00:35:24.980
At the time when He was challenged, you must
know when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980
stood up.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.319
He had nothing to do with the prostitute,
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:35.660
He stood up, He said, “Those who have not
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me.”

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.950
He was sure nobody can do it because He was
an authority of virtue.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:47.720
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.019
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you.

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:55.480
And people came, they were frightened, they
said, “What are You doing?”

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:03.892
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:05.590
you are secured.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:14.279
It is not by domination but the security that
you are love, you are compassion.

00:36:14.279 --> 00:36:23.730
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.840
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.700
There are many other things happen, you can
become a poet, I mean so many things happen

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.910
with this, because you become such a compassion,
such a compassion.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:45.000
And when this compassion starts working you
are given all the help that is needed.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.100
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:55.109
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it’s a marathon

00:36:55.109 --> 00:37:02.400
race for Me, so I'll try to make it short
now - it's the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.970
you is very important, this is America.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:10.670
Vishuddhi Chakra is America in the Universe.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:17.070
America is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star
is the Saturn.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:26.049
There are seventeen of them, sixteen is the
planet moving round, there are sixteen centers

00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:30.440
there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi
itself.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:38.569
Is a very important thing that this center
is America, so America has the responsibility

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:42.240
of transformation.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.829
They have to take up the responsibility of
transforming the whole world.

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:54.440
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:02.569
There is no fear from outside I tell you,
we are going to be ruined from inside.

00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:08.259
What a responsibility you have and what we
are doing you should see to that.

00:38:08.259 --> 00:38:15.440
That’s why so many seekers are born here,
but they do not feel the responsibility of

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.569
transformation.

00:38:16.569 --> 00:38:24.289
They will, one day it will come, they will
have to feel it, once they are awakened I'm

00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:27.509
sure they will feel that responsibility.

00:38:27.509 --> 00:38:37.589
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:46.200
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:56.420
We develop eyes which are full of compassion;
we develop a face which is innocent, which

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:04.690
is very smooth and which has got a capacity
to express its feeling.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.730
The smallest of feelings can be expressed
through this center.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:13.859
It looks after your nose, yours ears, everything
improves with this.

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:20.579
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:25.630
It is a very funny thing, unless and until
that person is very close I just can't hear

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.770
what he is saying, to Me, it is all what you
call “blah, blah, blah.”

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.019
But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks to Me I can
hear very well.

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:43.960
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:54.271
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

00:39:54.271 --> 00:39:59.089
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it.

00:39:59.089 --> 00:40:02.530
You feel like vomiting - you see something
horrid, you just feel like vomiting.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.950
You become so sensitive you can't imagine,
to virtue and to goodness.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:12.509
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you.

00:40:12.509 --> 00:40:15.780
I've seen people have changed overnight.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:22.119
The whole idea is that the light has to be
brought in for you to see for yourself, and

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:27.769
when it happens you'll be amazed, you become
such a different, wonderful person.

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:35.269
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:43.430
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:50.869
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:56.210
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:02.450
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.450
on the streets.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:07.700
You go in India in the villages, about they
were going to beat these people.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.749
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn’t get places in the hotels because

00:41:11.749 --> 00:41:15.670
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.099
money left with them.

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.640
Now they are begging in India, imagine.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.360
How can we afford to have these beggars there?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.380
They have no money with them, they can not
come back, they don't know what to do with

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.680
them, so many you will find in the villages
just begging.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:40.579
So this kind of thing that - imagine a person
who is being blessed by Shri Krishna Who is

00:41:40.579 --> 00:41:45.830
the Deity on this center, should beg!

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:50.640
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg?

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.619
This is the thing they don't understand, just
the opposite of what they are suppose to be.

00:41:57.619 --> 00:42:01.970
There are lots of stories of Krishna how He
blessed people with wealth.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:08.259
It is to be seen sometimes, if you have time,
I may have time then we might be able to see

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:12.259
all those beautiful things that He did.

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:17.190
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:23.460
This center is very important because this
is the gate through this you have to pass

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.160
to your destination which is the limbic area.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.839
So Christ is the gate, many people are shouting,
“it's only He can save.”

00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:32.480
Where is He now?

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.740
Is He here?

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.410
When He was living, they talked of Ibrahim,
when He came then they said, “You are not

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.410
the One.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.450
It was Moses.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.640
You are not the One.”

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.420
They denied Him, defied Him.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.759
Now when He's dead, then we think, “It is
Christ.”

00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:54.160
Now I have come, He's talked about Me, if
you read Bible you'll find He’s talked about

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.930
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.819
You are going to say that it was Christ Who
has to do it.

00:43:01.819 --> 00:43:07.140
If Christ could do it, why did He say that
“I'm going to send you a comforter”? He

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.569
talked of future, didn’t He?

00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:09.809
Why did He say such a thing?

00:43:09.809 --> 00:43:14.259
We should find out why did He say that “I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:15.890
and the Redeemer and a Counselor”?

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.869
Why did He say that?

00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:19.260
Why not look forward to that?

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.570
Because we are today after Christ.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:26.309
People don't want to see this point, they
want to depend on Christ because He's in their

00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:29.300
pocket, they can use Him the way they like.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:35.499
When He has talked, He has said, “Why not
see the point?”

00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:42.400
If this is what Christ is, then it is such
a bad thing because people say, “Christ

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.950
was no good.”

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:47.579
They say, “What has Christ given us?”

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:51.470
Christians nations, what have they done, what
have they achieved?

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.359
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work.

00:43:55.359 --> 00:44:04.029
I'm here to complete His work and when you
do not complete His work, His half-work done

00:44:04.029 --> 00:44:06.900
in a very half-way will bring bad name to
Him.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:12.030
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it?

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.960
If you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.819
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:21.819
the Hindus.

00:44:21.819 --> 00:44:24.499
There are all in a doldrum.

00:44:24.499 --> 00:44:32.740
Nobody has any understanding that they are
worshiping or they are admiring or advocating

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.599
a flower which belongs to one tree of life.

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:41.270
They have all plucked those flowers, “This
is mine, this is mine, in my pocket,” and

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:42.749
fighting.

00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:49.240
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.869
If it is integration, then it is a religion.

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:55.960
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:02.770
Christ has said, very clearly, “Those who
are not against Me are with Me.”

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:03.920
Who are those people?

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.640
Try to find out.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.250
For that you have to little bit go out of
Bible.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.900
In the Bible how much do you have Christ there,
for three years?

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.059
Nobody allowed Him to live for three years,
and if they could, they would also kill Me.

00:45:20.059 --> 00:45:26.170
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.170
time.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:34.369
So He has said that “You are to be resurrected
first, and then that's how you will be judged.”

00:45:34.369 --> 00:45:40.970
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.819
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:46.319
Through your Kundalini.

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:53.240
Your Kundalini is going to be awakened and
you'll be judged where you are.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.670
That's what it is, and those who will be calling
Me, “Christ, Christ” I will not look at

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.180
them, that's what it is.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.859
By calling Him “Christ, Christ” you do
not become Christians, you have to get your

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:09.329
Realization, your baptism in the actual sense.

00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:10.980
It has to be an actualization.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:16.470
I'm telling you that if you miss the point,
you have missed it for ever and ever.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.130
Be careful on that point.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.980
It's very important.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:26.800
Don't run after things which have no meaning
to your consciousness.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:33.369
Try to raise yourself up to this point and
understand that the time has come for you

00:46:33.369 --> 00:46:39.039
to transform, this is the time of your judgment
and you have to get to it in a very big way.

00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:41.910
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:47.289
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God?

00:46:47.289 --> 00:46:48.289
Nothing.

00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:54.690
If they do not take to His ways, all will
be treated like waste, thoroughly waste, it's

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:55.690
a wasteland.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:47:04.180
But if you rise, thousands and thousands and
millions and millions can be saved.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.430
Try to rise, try to understand your own responsibilities,
that is very important.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:16.470
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:23.930
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:29.170
Is integration of all the Deities, of all
the Prophets, all the great works that they

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:35.880
have done, integration of all the scriptures,
everything takes places when this Sahasrara

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.760
is opened out, when you become the Spirit.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.829
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:47.089
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.

00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:54.630
But I have to transform, not only transform
but you have to become, you cannot become

00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:02.059
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become

00:48:02.059 --> 00:48:06.480
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face
up to it, see for yourself.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.269
I am here to help you in every way possible.

00:48:12.269 --> 00:48:17.789
Whatever is possible we'll try to do it, but
you all should also understand your responsibility.

00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:20.380
It is not a joke now, it’s no more a joke.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:27.799
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere

00:48:27.799 --> 00:48:31.819
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha

00:48:31.819 --> 00:48:37.569
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

00:48:37.569 --> 00:48:39.089
It is not like that.

00:48:39.089 --> 00:48:41.339
It is a very serious thing which we must understand.

00:48:41.339 --> 00:48:45.599
We are at the brink of destruction, be careful
about it.

00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:50.749
We must do things so that the blessings of
God comes to upon us and that we are saved.

00:48:50.749 --> 00:48:58.630
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility
is much more on all the people who are getting

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:02.270
Realization, so do not treat it lightly.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:04.500
You all, I hope, will take it seriously.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:11.940
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:17.150
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:21.380
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:26.769
So please take it up seriously, work it out
seriously, and I tell you, out of you will

00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:31.589
come out those people who will build that
foundations of that construction which is

00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:33.160
going to come.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.140
Please don't waste your time in useless things,
get to it.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.829
Any one of you can do it.

00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:45.380
I bless you with My whole heart and know that
I love you very much.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:50.380
If you have any problems, you can write to
Me, but don't write to Me about your family

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:54.210
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.240
Of course I'm a mother, if you have problems
you can write but some people write ten pages

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.339
saying, “my wife is fighting me.”

00:50:00.339 --> 00:50:01.749
It's bit too much.

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:05.589
You should write to Me about the problems
which concern the whole country, concern the

00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:06.859
whole world.

00:50:06.859 --> 00:50:14.780
Widen yourself and that’s how, though you
may think that you are very unassuming simple

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:18.950
people, you are the ones who are going to
be, not those who are successful, they are

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.849
blinded by their success; not those who are
rich, they are not going to enter into the

00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:26.890
Kingdom of God; not those who have a big name,
no.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:55.970
It's you, you are going to enter into the
Kingdom 

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:06.300
of God.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:47.630
May God bless you.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:52:08.300
[Self Realization]

00:52:08.300 --> 00:53:49.819
Now, all the angels have a seat, now, put
your hands towards Me like this, and close

00:53:49.819 --> 00:53:52.589
your eyes, the vibrations are so much today,
nothing to do.

00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:55.329
Just so much vibrations tonight, it's tremendous.

00:53:55.329 --> 00:54:16.269
Just close your eyes, you'll feel the cool
breeze, most of you, close your eyes please.

00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:26.410
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:30.890
little higher, on top of your head.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.660
Hmm, it’s there.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:41.309
Now put your right hand towards Me and put
the left hand and see, little higher, about

00:54:41.309 --> 00:55:11.950
six inches higher, six inches higher, change
over, again, now put your hands up like this

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:21.859
absolutely, close the eyes and ask, “Is
this the breeze of the Holy Ghost” or ask

00:55:21.859 --> 00:55:34.450
the question “Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:42.859
You feel the cool breeze?

00:55:42.859 --> 00:55:48.479
Good, it's tremendous today.

00:55:48.479 --> 00:55:51.690
May God bless you all.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:58.619
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands.

00:55:58.619 --> 00:56:00.900
One, two and three.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.900
Are keeping all right?

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.400
You are not well?

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:18.780
All right, doesn't matter, if you are not
well maybe you may not feel today but you'll

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.829
get well and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't
matter.

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:27.150
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it’s so tremendous today, May God bless

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.150
you.

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:37.140
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.510
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:45.069
for you to go to Santa Cruz.

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:48.160
Thank you very much.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:57.140
I say goodbye to you, after a year I’ll
definitely will come to Los Angeles again,

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.140
those who haven't cool breeze should keep
their hands raised.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.579
These boys will come and see you.

00:57:00.579 --> 00:57:05.500
All right, those people who haven't got it,
please keep your hands slightly raised so

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:14.730
some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you.

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.339
Here just have a look.

00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:20.329
Man in the Audience: I didn’t hear Your
last question.

00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:21.386
I didn’t understand what You asked about
the Holy Ghost.

00:57:21.386 --> 00:57:30.049
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:34.799
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:35.799
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:57:35.799 --> 00:57:36.950
Otherwise how will you recognize?

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:42.750
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:44.450
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:45.579
You don’t understand that.

00:57:45.579 --> 00:57:46.990
You don’t teach Me Bible.

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.260
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn’t
say.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:58:04.849
You don’t tell Me.

00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:25.539
You have no knowledge.

00:58:25.539 --> 00:58:41.059
Don’t disturb others.

00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:53.910
If you are such a good person you ...

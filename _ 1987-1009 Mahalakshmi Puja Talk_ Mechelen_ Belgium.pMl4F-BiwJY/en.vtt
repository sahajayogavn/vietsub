00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.810
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:17.960
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:30.460
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:52.520
[translation follows - yes] It is a .. it
is a new dimension I think, I feel, we are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.600
entering into.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:06.570
Because now we are really getting people who
are seriously interested in their realization

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.939
and are very respectful.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.500
And that aggressiveness is much less.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.950
You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:39.139
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:52.179
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.950
Now this Sahaj manner should be understood.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.960
In a Sahaj manner, when they come to you,
you must know they are absolutely new to Sahaja

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.610
Yoga.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.159
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:36.920
You should not tell them anything about Me;
but you have to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.950
and about yourself.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.879
Like you can say, “I had the same problem
as you have.”

00:02:46.879 --> 00:03:00.269
Or you can say that “See, it took me more
time then it 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.310
took you.”

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.650
It’s a little lie, but doesn’t matter.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.579
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:22.069
You see, because first of all, you must understand
human beings.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.641
If you tell them directly “You are bad”
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:37.099
they will run away, though it is true.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.920
A lady from France came to see Me.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:52.820
She said that “They told me I’m evil.”

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.680
So I said, “No, no you are not.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.010
Who told you that?”

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.760
And gradually she improved.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:15.950
So you have to tell them that “You are the
Spirit” and whatever is hanging on to them

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:32.210
will be dropped out 
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:44.250
So if that happens they feel happy and they
get their benevolence.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.199
It is how beautifully you handle another person.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.140
Now there maybe people who want to argue.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.410
With them you should say, “You know, you
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:13.660
human awareness.”

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.590
And you better tell them that it is … “You
better take your Realization, then we will

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.680
talk about it.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.550
Not before your Realization.”

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.080
So then, if they are not getting any Realization,
you don’t tell them that “There is a bhoot

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.620
sitting in your left Nabhi or right Nabhi.”

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:53.190
This is our language – Sahaja Yogi’s language,
not their language.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:03.919
Ya, so you have to be very careful to handle
them very carefully.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:11.520
Now there could be a problem between, say,
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.349
or maybe husband and wife.

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.410
So …

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:29.090
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right?

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.490
All of you should pay attention to Me.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.479
All right?

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.460
No, no it’s all right.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.460
Let her be there.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.340
It’s all right, but she should pay attention
this time, all right?

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.500
Sit down.)

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:55.979
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:11.129
joy will start giving you strength.”

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:19.470
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you - 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:29.240
see you’re honest, your purpose and would
try to appreciate you.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.630
Gradually it works out.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:47.370
But if it does not, then we’ll see about
it.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:08:00.400
Now when you handle them with love and care,
you can establish them.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:13.139
But if they start misbehaving you also should
not lose temper at all.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:17.639
You should be very forgiving.

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:29.569
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders.

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:32.349
Of course, you might not find them perfect,
maybe.

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:52.370
Or maybe 
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.940
But you need some bossing sometimes.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:09.980
And leaders must know how to also correct
people, because you need correction.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:20.540
I met a lady, I was telling you, we had told
them, that you need not have a guru.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:27.800
So, she said “No, no we must have somebody
to guide us.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:40.940
And that guru will guide us and also will
support us, so we would like to follow him.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.529
In spite of the fact he is a very bossy fellow
and he always gets annoyed with us and he

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:50.050
takes money from us.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:10:15.200
And it’s not a guru, if he’s not, if he
is very soft, means he should not be kind.”

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:25.980
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate 

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.240
them for their spiritual ascent.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:41.420
They are better people, because they want
their ascent in any case.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:48.350
And they accept corrections, because they
want their ascent.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.260
That’s the first thing.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:11:03.360
So even if the leader bosses, they like it
very much.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:19.410
In some places people told Me, “Our guru
is very soft – we must get some strong fellow.”

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:40.529
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:44.050
good.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:53.430
But should not compromise with nonsense and
laziness.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:12:01.170
Because the first thing, people get into is
laziness after Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:08.790
We have to be committed.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:16.839
Now I too have a family and I have grandchildren.

00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:19.880
My daughter has come all the way to see Me
in London.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:30.829
She’s been there for one month and I haven’t
been there yet.

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:38.260
She’s waiting for Me.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.040
So it’s all right, one has to do it.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:51.910
This is My commitment, because this is your
purpose of life.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:13:07.850
And the purpose that you have mainly is to
ascend and help others to ascend.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:16.770
You are special people, who have to do such
a tremendous task.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:25.779
Otherwise how can we have lots of people coming
to Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:37.570
So the Sahaja way is to yourself improve with
meditation 

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:45.930
and introspect yourself and see yourself.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:57.339
You must meditate and you should not see the
defects of others.

00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:05.370
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:17.740
If you do not meet collectively every day,
then there will be a problem.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.269
In the collective only the maturity starts.

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:29.550
It is a living process as I told you.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:39.470
Now supposing a tree is growing and you take
out a leaf from there and the leaf will say,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.420
“I’m going to grow by myself.”

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:48.240
It cannot grow.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:56.339
It will be left out.

00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:03.100
So that is what one has to remember: that
it is a collective happening.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:11.290
We all have to meet and grow together.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:26.630
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:37.370
I think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:48.980
It is just like a tree growing and with the
tree everything else that belongs to tree

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.550
also grows.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:16:02.810
So for the growth of this tree one has to
remember that you have to stick onto the tree.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:15.579
But the tree is not going to run after you,
“Stick on, stick on to me, stick on to me.”

00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:25.370
For that whatever has to be done, has to be
done.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:35.110
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves
fall off.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:42.810
What they do is to create a barrier between
themselves and the tree by some living process.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:54.920
They create a barrier in between, there's
a little bark that comes in between.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:09.710
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.950
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:25.530
When you do not accept the principle of Sahaja
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:38.270
and 
the leaf.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:45.480
Now when that happens, the leaf falls off.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:56.780
So you have to open out yourself, your heart,
everything to suck in the sap to nourish.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:10.220
You have to give up your Ego and Superego,
your conditionings and ideas you have had

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.550
from before.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:26.510
This is what is the surrender, is the Islam.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.250
And that is to be achieved.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:38.920
But that is not going to help the tree, it
is going to help you.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.130
Now some people say, “I'm not ready.”

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.750
Then how will you grow?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:57.390
Actually when a little child is born, immediately
it wants to suck in the mother's nourishment.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:15.880
It feels it has starved all this time and
it should suck mother's milk immediately.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:24.750
And all those are seekers, once they find
their Realization must behave in that manner.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:34.970
They should all give up all the conditionings
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:55.730
push themselves and also cleanse themselves
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.340
But it does not happen that way.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:08.770
That's why some people do not grow that fast.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:18.680
It is a pure intelligence that gives you that
sense I think.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:28.850
Pure intelligence comes from pure heart and
if you pay more attention to your heart, your

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:36.450
Spirit, then it will work out.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:50.770
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:21:01.830
Not only that you’ll have the blessings
but you will have jobs, you will have money

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:11.160
or else children will pass with flying colors.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.290
They will become obedient.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:29.890
Your health will improve, you will get money,
you will get married, you will have nice children,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:42.960
wise wife, you’ll get homes and ashrams.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.780
But these are all temptations.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:56.240
Many people get lost in one of those.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:09.900
Now supposing I've to catch the plane and
on the way I see very nice gardens or things,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:22.930
then I get down to enjoy the gardens, how
will I reach the airport and the aeroplane?

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:30.690
So these temptations must be seen as just
entertainments…

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:37.580
as entertainments.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:47.910
Entertainment, all right?

00:22:47.910 --> 00:23:05.460
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:12.200
But if you start thinking you’ll go mad.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:25.420
How can you explain that a person just like
you can give Realization to thousands?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:36.140
How can you explain that you can see the sun
on My heart in a picture?

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.680
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain?

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:49.850
For example, you get My photographs in the
sky, is a fact.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:56.870
How will you explain that?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.140
So it is beyond your brains.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.450
So better not think about it.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.090
Just gradually accept the joy.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:21.480
I always say I've done the cooking for you
and very good food.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:31.050
Now only thing is for you to eat it and taste
it.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:39.220
Why do you want to know, how it was cooked,
when it was kept and what else has been done

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:49.750
to make it so tasty?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:56.730
You should just appreciate and enjoy.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:02.850
Like a painting you have, you don't think,
“From where did he get the paint, how did

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:18.850
he paint and how was he sitting, what food
he must have taken, before or after?”

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:28.820
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:38.740
It's very surprising, that people do not understand
one simple thing: that Kundalini has risen

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:49.170
without thinking and not by our effort.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:26:02.240
The Kundalini has given us this good health,
good temperament and has changed us so much.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:12.770
So She is going to do the job, only thing
we should try to support Her and to keep our

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.200
central path clean.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.160
It's very simple.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:30.540
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:36.500
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.020
come to India.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:44.770
But try to come, because those who have been
to India have settled down much better, because

00:26:44.770 --> 00:27:13.640
India has got something magical about it,
that it transforms people to a deeper level.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:46.830
You should not come half heartedly.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.580
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.570
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:02.550
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:14.120
You 
have to come with full force, as I told you

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:25.730
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:33.550
Don't play into the tricks of your mind.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:46.090
It's like a donkey - if you take a donkey
lightly, then it will just start grazing anywhere

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.370
it finds grass.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:29:04.230
And if it knows that the person sitting on
his back is a lousy fellow or a lazy person,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:10.220
it will drop him.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:23.570
And when it knows that it can go ahead of
the person then it can even kick you back.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:28.020
That is how your mind is.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:43.390
It dominates you, it sometimes starts grazing
on pastures and you think that's a very good

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:56.460
thing, you are very peaceful or else it starts
dominating you.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.210
So how to manage this donkey?

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:10.680
Best way is to catch hold of the ears, and
carry it with you.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:19.810
Donkey is for you, you are not for the donkey.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:31.190
So this is one of the hurdles, that we have
very much.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:41.170
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:46.160
not by brain, but by heart.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:31:02.050
I have known people who can give big lectures
on Sahaja Yoga, can write books, but have

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.580
no vibrations.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.260
So this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:14.370
You have to be a Yogi.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.540
That's a religion in a way in our being.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:26.700
That's the religion of a Yogi.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:38.169
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies.

00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:48.770
And the eleventh valency integrates you with
the religion.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:32:10.000
You get identified with righteousness, with
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:23.760
- or also detachment.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.850
That means you do not expect anything.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:33.570
You do it for doing’s sake.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.920
You love for loving’s sake.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.270
That's the best way to enjoy.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.220
You enjoy your loving capacity.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:52.140
You enjoy your generosity.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:58.290
You enjoy your forgiveness.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:05.560
Enjoy all these great qualities of righteousness.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:15.410
You’ll never feel hurt.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:21.120
I do that all the time.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.750
That's how I'm always happy and full of joy.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.810
May God bless you!

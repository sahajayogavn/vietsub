00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:16.740
It was really very enjoyable today, to see
all of you, in such a happy mood.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.930
What happiness what joy Sahaja Yoga has brought
to all of you.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:33.940
It’s really, I could never have imagined,
that people could be that joyous and, that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.650
relaxed, as you were this evening.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:51.040
Also it shows, how much you have understood,
the stupidity of this hypocrisy going on in

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.730
the Name of God.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:04.640
Not only that, that you have understood, but,
the way you have depicted it, showed also

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:15.220
your great, art of acting, art of bringing
out the salient points of all this hypocrisy.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.870
There are many people who can see this point,
not that only we see, many people must be

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:42.060
knowing about it also, but you have the power
now, to, accept it, understand it, and realize

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.320
it, as the truth, that they are really hypocrites.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:59.570
We have human beings, who of course, do not
want to accept, do not want to see.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.680
They have closed their eyes, blind faith in
all those hypocritical people, somehow or

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.900
other, they lack reasoning, understanding,
logic.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:24.670
But there are some who understand, who have
this, full image of these people in different

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.180
countries, in different, religions and all
these guru people.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.190
They understand it.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:46.890
But still, they cannot, go against it, they
dare not say anything against it, and even

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:59.209
if they say, it will be in a very, hush-hush
manner, not so openly as we did it today.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:14.450
Though it was very hilarious, and very enjoyable,
but behind all this comedy I felt the tragedy,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:29.540
because, there are so many, who are suffering,
who are being looted, who are being cheated,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:45.879
who are being used, morally who have been
crushed.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:54.069
And I don’t know how many, cruel things
are going behind the scene in the Name of

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.480
God.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.830
Such a tragedy that, is still going on in
these modern times.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:10.089
But you are all very lucky and fortunate people,
that you have dropped all this nonsense, all

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:20.440
the shackles of blind faith and now, you are
all enjoying the freedom of your Spirit.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.659
It’s something I enjoyed the most.

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:37.860
You have to understand, that we are now in
the Kingdom of God, so we can see the reality,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.409
very clearly, and in the Kingdom of the God
we are looked after, all the time by the Divine

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.409
Power.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:57.830
How it works out, how it looks after us, is
extremely remarkable.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:12.379
As you saw one drama, the one after all these
actors coming on the stage, we actually, saw

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:21.840
ourselves a drama in India, without organizing,
very spontaneous, just like it was today,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.000
but without any organization, a beautiful
drama we saw which I must tell you, so that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.909
you will understand how much this Divine Power
is working it out.

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:43.039
You remember we had a very bad time in Angapur
when these people threw stones and so many

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:50.039
were hurt, if you remember that night, and
we were in trouble.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:57.720
And we had filed a case, but the case was
not somehow or other started, and it was the

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:07.530
date, something, where I could not be there,
but still the case was there and we didn’t

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.510
know what was happening.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.220
There was one man who had come when we were
having this program.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:24.000
His name was Anant Beransbe and he told Me
that he’s from the television and he wants

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to have his Realization.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So I said: ‘I cannot just now I have to
speak, so you can go on the back side and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.860
sit down and we’ll see if we can manage
your Realization.’

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:41.599
When these people, you heard the story, that
it was they who had arranged this man from

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:49.800
television to come, those who had been throwing
stones at us, these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.229
molan] people.

00:06:51.229 --> 00:07:03.199
And we didn’t know what to do, so, a son-in-law
of our Home Minister, came to My house in

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.340
Pradisthan and asked for Realization.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.840
I was quite surprised this man coming down
for Realization.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.610
And then I told him what is happening to us.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.339
He said: ‘No no you can go and see this
Home Minister.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:25.120
‘ Now this Home Minister is a great disciple
of our asatya Baba, imagine.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:34.099
I said: ‘It’s really; I don’t know how
it will work out this stupid fellow, this

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.379
disciple of asatya Sai Baba.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.370
So just see the drama.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:52.040
He was quite hesitant, and with Me Rajesh
Shah, Yogi Mahajan and one Nirvika who is

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.680
from the same area as this Minister who had
arranged this meeting.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.319
So we went there.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:07.301
So the private secretary had a great respect
for Me, so he called the car inside, we couldn’t

00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:08.301
understand.

00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.301
Then he came and touched My Feet.

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:11.110
I was quite surprised.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:18.889
Then I went and sat with this Home Minister,
and his wife came in and she touched My Feet.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:22.719
I was quite surprised, and she said: ‘You
don’t remember me?’

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:26.391
I said: ‘I think I’ve seen you somewhere.’

00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.979
She said: ‘You’ve forgotten we had gone
together to London.’

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:38.440
There was a, offer from Air India for people
who have been doing social work, as a sort

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.010
of a reward that we could go to England and
come back.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:49.430
So there were quite a lot of ladies who went
and the Chief Minister’s wife also came

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:56.380
and she was, actually he’s Chief Minister
at that time and she’s his wife.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.730
They were very well known to My family.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.980
Actually their marriage was arranged by My
father also.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:10.951
So they were, all sort of, they were new this
western culture, very old-fashioned ladies,

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.140
all old ladies you see, traveling with Me
to London.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.730
There you see they were so shocked at the
dance they saw and everything, they said:

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.820
‘What are these dirty people doing here?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.160
Why are they showing us these dirty things,
and we are not dirty women.’

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.470
And like that you see they were.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.280
I had to tell them all right: ‘They have
this kind of dances only.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.370
If you don’t want to see we can go out.’

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.330
Went out and all of them started vomiting
there.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.900
So it was such a bad condition with them.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.190
So they stuck on to Me in London, all of them,
and one of them was the wife of this gentleman,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.410
and she said: ‘That if You remember we all
stuck on to You.’

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.070
They were all older than Me, because they
couldn’t understand what’s happening in

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:58.410
these countries because they had never seen
such dances, such women, such men.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.920
She said: ‘But why are these Air India people
troubling us like this?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.920
Why do they want to shock us?’

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.230
I said: ‘It’s all right.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.290
That is their entertainment style doesn’t
matter and all.’

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.070
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned women have come

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.010
here and they can’t stand all this nonsense.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.480
But this lady said that: ‘See how You supported
us, how You helped us, otherwise we are all

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.580
collapsing you see there.’

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.950
So this lady was very sweet and then she started
telling her husband: ‘You know She was quite

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.220
young but She was very wise and She looked
after us, and She did this and She was the

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.780
youngest and all.’

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.460
Then suddenly one girl, now one by one on
the stage, first of all the wife came in,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.220
then they announced: ‘There’s a lady called
Nirmala Deshbande who wants to meet her.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.960
So they said: ‘No no just now I’m talking
to Shri Mataji.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.570
I’ll see her later.’

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.780
‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her, she knows
Me very well.’

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.460
So this Nirmala Deshbande was with Me in 1942
Movement – imagine the drama.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.770
She should come that day only, in the morning
time.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:13.020
Actually the whole, I mean our, interview
was fixed for the previous evening but it

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.670
was postponed for next morning and next morning
one by one how these people are coming on

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.900
the stage.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.880
First his wife, and we are already given a
nice ulta bandhan, the other way round, to

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:34.800
this two photographs of Mr Narakasura, lest
he starts pouring some pribhooties from his

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.410
photographs.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.820
Then this lady this Nirmala Deshbande she
came.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.250
As soon as she saw Me she just fell at My
Feet, she started hugging Me.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.730
She said: ‘How long we have… are meeting
now this that.’

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:54.060
She even forgot the Home Minister was sitting
there, nothing of the kind, and they all started

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.130
looking at her.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.750
‘Oh you don’t know her?

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.030
She was our Leader, you see She was like a
real Shakti how She faced the Britishers you

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.030
have no idea.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.730
You people have become Ministers but this
is the Lady who fought for the freedom.’

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:22.260
And all she gave a big lecture to the Home
Minister and Home Minister – like this.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.590
But this is not the end.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.480
Then, she wouldn’t talk to him.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.260
She was just talking to Me and she said: ‘Oh
You have been doing great work.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.390
I have heard about You.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.700
I’ve been longing to meet You, but just
imagine, today I’ve come and You are here

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.790
after such a long time.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.430
Oh you don’t know what a loving Lady She
is.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.740
She was so sweet to us.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.560
She was much younger to me in age and we were
so many girls you see, boys, all of them She

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.410
organized and She was so young and still She
was so brave.’

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.890
And she was describing everything.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.000
I was quite embarrassed.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.690
So the Minister didn’t know why she had
come there, then.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.730
Then I said: ‘All right now I’m going.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.580
I told him the whole story, gave him all the
papers and he couldn’t help it, he had to

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.760
sign all right: ‘Please do something about
it or something’.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.030
He wrote to the main man in Maharashtra.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:22.130
I told him about all these and how Rajneesh
has planned this, and all this was done by

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.950
Rajneesh people, because we have proof of
that.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.780
Then we came out.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.640
We came out and there was one lady who again
touched My Feet, in the verandah.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.980
I couldn’t recognize her very well.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.940
She said: ‘Have You forgotten?

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:44.720
I’m the Maharani of Satara’, where this
incident had taken – you know Angapur is

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.890
close to Satara.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.480
‘Ah I remember.’

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.620
‘You came in 1972.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:57.310
We had a nice meeting in our palace and my
mother-in-law the Rajmata invited You, she

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.110
washed Your Feet.’

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.610
I said: ‘Yes yes I remember.’

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.810
‘But You forgot us.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.780
You never met us after that.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.170
Now You have to come to the wedding of my
son.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.220
I’ve come to invite the Home Minister.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.050
You have to come to the wedding of my son.’

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.710
I said: ‘I’m going away tomorrow to Rome.’

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.540
She said: ‘No no no I’ll take You.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.160
I’ll do this.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.910
So all right, at least You must ask this Home
Minister to come.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.550
He’ll listen to You, I’m sure he’ll
listen to You.’

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.930
I just kept quiet.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.720
So, then you see there was a gentleman standing
with her.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.310
So she went inside.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:41.130
He said: ‘Shri Mataji,’ he touched My
Feet, ‘I’ve met You before, and You have

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.150
given me Realization.’

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.860
I said: ‘What’s your name?’

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.590
He said: ‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.150
I said: ‘What?’

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.030
‘I met You in Angapur.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.030
I’m Anant Beransbe.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.030
I was there.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.030
You remember?’

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.030
I said: ‘Yes of course.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.530
Why did you come to Angapur?’

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.540
He said: ‘Only a Sahaja Yoga brought me
there.’

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.940
‘But you were not brought by the [Sounds
Like: andar sadar]?’

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.000
He said: ‘No never, why would I come with
these horrible people?’

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.250
‘So what happened?’

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.790
He said: ‘Only four days back I was in Satara
and the case started and they had taken me

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.970
there.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:21.690
So I told them that, I saw seven people being
hit by these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar] people.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.960
And they were all bleeding.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.520
And I was so upset with it that I couldn’t
bear it.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.830
I ran away from there.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.590
But one thing I must say: ‘Mataji was telling
everybody: ‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.590
doesn’t matter.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.590
Some stones are coming.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.590
Just keep quiet.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.920
Don’t throw any stones.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.060
Don’t do anything.’

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.370
He told there in the Court.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.990
Can you imagine this fellow, in our absence?

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.700
And after one year I met him and then they
started saying: ‘Oh Mataji must have given

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.600
him laques of rupees that’s why he’s talking
like this.’

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.170
They thought he was their witness, just imagine.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.600
I said: ‘Really?’

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:08.210
Immediately I told that private secretary:
‘Bring our petition.’

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:13.610
And we cut out all that was written against
this Anant Beransbe, otherwise he would have

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.230
been in trouble.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.230
Imagine.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.120
And then said: ‘Really?’

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.500
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why don’t
You come in and tell the Home Minister to

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.480
come to attend my son’s wedding?

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.040
At least he should do Mother.’

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.810
So I went with her and this fellow also came
Anant Beransbe and I said: ‘This is that

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.380
same fellow Anant Beransbe, but he’s telling
something else.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.480
And then he started telling them, how they
hit and how they were this thing.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.590
He said this Dr [SOUNDS LIKE: Tabuker?] he’s
a devil.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.000
And all we had written against him in that,
imagine.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.240
Can you imagine such a story?

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.370
This fellow, this Anant Beransbe, who was
mentioned in that petition of ours, should

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.310
be there on that morning there standing, waiting
for Me.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:06.140
Then he asked him two-three questions, the
Home Minister: ‘What are they doing?’

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.140
‘Nothing.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.120
They were hitting one after another seven
people I saw and I got such a fright I ran

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.510
away with my camera, couldn’t bear it and
Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t hit, don’t

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.510
hit’.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.510
She was so quiet.’

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.130
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.890
So went we came out, despite that he was a
disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:33.970
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me, then Nirmala Deshbande comes

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:40.110
in, then this Maharani comes in, and then
after that, and the Maharani herself praising

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.430
Me a lot, that I cured her mother-in-law and
all.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:50.780
And then comes in Mr, this Anant Beransbe,
and he told them the whole story, and this

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.720
Home Minister didn’t know where to look.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.490
Asatya Sai Baba and whole thing was finished
into nowhere.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:02.730
So see how the drama worked, and we were so
amazed at the whole thing.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:21.390
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother it
was Mahasahaja Yoga.’

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.160
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.270
You must know that it all works out.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:33.860
But you must also know that you must have
faith in paramachaitanya.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.460
Also faith in yourself that you are in the
Kingdom of God.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.720
I was very happy today the way you enjoyed
all that and understood it but, one thing

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:55.910
is there, that you all should, not that only
enjoy this but feel it, as a responsibility.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:04.110
We have to, point it out to the whole world,
how hypocritical they are, how they are using

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:18.260
the name of God, and how they are ruining
people, by their, tricks.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.090
So today I don’t want to tell you lots of
things.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:31.000
Today is a day still the Christ has not Risen
as they say but I don’t know at this time,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:40.010
He must have come out of His grave already,
as it is because, He came out and He was standing

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:47.660
outside when His Mother came and asked Him:
‘Who are You?’

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.059
She couldn’t even Recognize Him.

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:53.210
She couldn’t even believe that Christ has
Risen.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:01.010
In the same way we also forget that we have
Risen and that we are completely transformed,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.640
and we are free, absolutely free people.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:16.220
Nothing can dominate us, none of our conditionings,
none of our ego, nothing can dominate us,

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.780
none of our habits.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:25.010
Everything has died out and we are free birds
to fly and to enjoy our flights.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.400
This is what we have to realize.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.770
May God bless you.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.290
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t
give Me any prizes, nothing.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.030
It’s too much.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.070
It is too much of presentations.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:48.760
I mean I don’t know why you are giving Me
all these things all the time, but you think

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.420
that, that’s only your privilege that so
you have to do it.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.990
So I have to have certain privileges, I can
also give you presents.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:05.860
So I have bought some very small ones for
all of you, those who are here in Rome.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:12.790
For Cabella people I bought last time, but
I’ll also do it when they come there.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.230
And for other countries also I’ll be giving
them whenever I go there but just now it is

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.770
for the people of Rome and the leaders.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.480
Leaders, I’m also afraid of them, because
sometimes you see, if they get angry they

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.670
can form a union against Me you know.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.190
So One has to be careful with them.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:42.470
So there’s little presents for all of them
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…

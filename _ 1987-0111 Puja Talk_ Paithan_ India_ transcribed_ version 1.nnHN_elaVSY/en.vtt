00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.939
You must have felt the vibrations of this
place; they are tremendous.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.990
And that we should come here after so many
years is really very much surprising.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:08.050
This place has a great connection with Me
as such because My forefathers ruled in this

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.930
place, and this was the capital of Shalivanas
called as Pratishthan, and then they made

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.430
it easier as Paithan.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.860
They were the rulers here for thousands of
years.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.180
And they are the ones who started this Shalivahan
Dynasty, actually they called themselves as

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.049
Sath Vahan, means seven vahanas.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.410
They represented the seven vahanas of the
seven chakras.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.760
It's surprising how it is so Sahaj.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.889
After that there was a great poet, as you
know about him, Gyaneshwara, who came here.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:02.870
He was born very close to this place, who
was here for quite some time.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.900
And there was one fellow who was a very supraconscious
person who challenged him.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.269
His name was Changdev.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:24.440
So he said that “What do you have with you
to show that you have got God with you?”

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:39.340
And there was a male buffalo with him, male
buffalo, which was just walking on the road,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.989
and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda
Mantras.

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.959
And this Changdev try to show some tricks.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:01.170
Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister,
was sitting on a broken wall and he made the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.790
wall move with all of them in the air.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.650
And then he realized, Chandev, that this is
some sort of an incarnation on this earth.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:24.340
Apart from that, there's another great poet
called Eknath who has written lots of folk

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.050
songs, like Namadeva, describing Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:45.400
So this place had some sort of attractive
focus of vibrations for all these great saints

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.530
to come and settle down.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.930
They've excavated lots of old things about
this place and the sari that is given to the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.350
Goddess here is made in this place, called
as Paithani.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.110
It started in the time of Shalivana and that
art is still there.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.260
That's the only sari in which they use real
gold as the thread, real gold.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.240
Just for the Goddess.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.180
So this place is still very vibrating, is
out of the way for the people to come down,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:38.090
thank God, so it still maintains its own vibration,
its goodness and its purity.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.740
And you are all very lucky people in this
group to have come to this place and to have

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.740
visited this.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.560
As you will go round you will see there is
a beautiful garden next to it.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.220
The river Godawari is called as the Ganga,
the Ganges of the South.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:07.880
It starts from Nasik where you were before,
and then brought here and a big dam is made

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.520
for the supply of water all over which you
can see on your way.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.630
There is a beautiful garden nearby and Eknath's
temple is just behind here.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:26.760
So we can all go and have a look at it also.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.089
I am happy you went and saw Ajanta caves.

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:40.450
Should show you how people were dedicated,
to build all that in ten centuries.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.870
They had not seen Buddha at all; Buddha never
came to the south of India.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:55.320
Just believing in Buddha what work they did,
what sacrifices, how they built it.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:04.029
They had to go through very difficult times
because there was no water, there was no communication,

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.029
nothing.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:10.730
And they used the stones, you must have seen
there, of different colors and different hues

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.730
which are created by Mother Earth.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:25.250
And when you break them, inside those egg-like
stones you get beautiful, semi-precious stones.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.990
They dissolved them into some sort of an indigenous
solvent and used it for painting.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.719
And that's how the paintings are today surviving.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:39.289
You can't see without lights, so how they
must have painted it at that time?

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:41.510
What sort of eyes they must be having?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:48.760
Their dedication gave them this power that
they could build it.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.720
They carried on for ten centuries this work.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.659
If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries,
this world would be a different place.

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:02.990
So one has to learn that we have to dedicate.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.920
We must fully dedicate ourselves.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.110
We are not here to gain everything out of
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:18.590
Like in the beginning, people have problems
about their families, so they think that God

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.780
should solve the problem because they have
come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.320
now, so God must solve their problems.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.709
Now they have problems of their jobs, God
must solve the problem.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:31.370
If they have problems with their relations,
so God must solve their problems.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:37.500
That's the sort of a job given to God because
they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.479
Then, after that, God must give them money.

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.469
He must provide them for everything.

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:45.710
And He must look after them.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.860
For no commitment at all, there is no commitment.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.002
Nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:50.002 --> 00:08:53.390
But God is committed, and God has to work
it out.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:09:00.269
Then they start, some people, foolishly start
using Sahaja Yoga for other purposes, like

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:07.860
earning money or earning power, or name, or
fame, or domination or anything.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:17.510
These are the steps which are going down,
not upwards.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:23.560
And then, once you go down you don't realize
whether you are going upward or downward.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.450
So in dedication one has to see: what have
I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga?

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.310
All the time I have problems.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.371
All the time I say I can't do this because
of that, I can't do that because of this,

00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.310
there’s the problem, this I would like to
do, this I would like to do.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.620
All the time there’s an I, I, I and I, but
what have I dedicated?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.839
What time have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:52.190
How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.100
Nothing at all.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.519
People don't even take leave for Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.060
They can't do anything for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.350
These people not only took leave, but permanently
went and settled in that place, in that far-fetched

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.350
place.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:14.870
Without any machinery, without anything they
did that whole painting and the whole excavation

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:24.100
and all that, what you call the entire work
of such a tremendous volume that is impossible

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.870
in these modern times.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.249
Nobody can recreate something like that - with
all your machinery, with everything - because

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:33.660
people don't have dedication.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.300
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves
onto a point: What did I do?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.670
What did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.670
Nothing.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:49.310
It's only for my own child or maybe for my
wife, or for myself, or for my job or for

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.310
something.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.420
What is our commitment?

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:59.170
And without commitment, purity cannot come
in.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:04.769
You will go up and down like a yo-yo.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.070
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:17.970
If there are even five people who are really
fully committed to Sahaja Yoga it can be built

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.959
up that way.

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:30.319
But the problem is everybody shares with each
other this kind of non-committal behavior.

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:34.999
And that’s something not good.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:39.579
Committed means even if we have to give our
life we should do it.

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:47.370
Even if we have to give up everything, we
should do it.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.110
But all other considerations are to be taken
there, everything should work out.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.970
So all should be joy all the time, you must
get your jobs, you must get your wives, you

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:07.149
must get your everything, children properly
done, everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:13.870
And when this commitment will start I am sure
Sahaja Yoga will spread like anything.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:20.620
Even falsehood, when people are committed,
like you see in all other religions, every

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.550
religion they did that.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.360
And how much it has spread.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.839
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful.

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:30.649
It blesses you all the time.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:34.980
It gives you a very long rope to hang you
also sometimes.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.170
One must know that it’s a blessing of that
kind also.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:46.110
So one has to be very, very alert that God
has chosen us for such a special work and

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:53.240
we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:01.280
All those who are wise will take to this and
understand that the life is only worth this,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280
otherwise it's useless.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
It's good for nothing.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.459
It has no meaning.

00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:18.170
And this has to come from, first from the
leaders and then from others.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.420
Complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.970
It doesn't mean that you have to give up anything.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.069
For My sake you don't have to do anything.

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:36.870
But for your own sake, for your own betterment
you have to do it.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:46.379
I hope next time when you come to India you
will be coming better prepared for commitments.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:53.260
It's not only money, it's not only your talking
about, your saying about it, writing about

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.110
it, but it is through your own being it should
happen.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:06.629
You all should become the source of energy
that I want to emit all over the world.

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:09.600
That light which is going to enlighten.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.670
No amount of artificiality is going to work
it out, but complete genuineness within you.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.420
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they
didn't have Mother to help them.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.939
This Gyaneshwara's life if you read you will
be shocked.

00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:26.570
He didn't have even shoes to walk.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:33.269
He was treated so badly because his father
was a sanyasi and was married so they said

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.149
that these are the children of a sanyasi.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:36.760
They had no food to eat.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:44.119
They had to walk for miles together bare feet,
they had no blessings of the Mother on them.

00:14:44.119 --> 00:14:54.959
Despite that they kept to Sahaja Yog, kept
to their blessings of being one with God.

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:58.459
Because they achieved that state.

00:14:58.459 --> 00:15:09.089
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence
that you get all the blessings.

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:14.410
But that doesn't mean that you should stagnate,
that you should not progress.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.290
One has to progress higher and higher.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.209
One has to decide the commitment.

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:23.269
I am committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:30.660
And that is what you have to be, committed.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:39.380
May God bless you all.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.129
Today we’ll – being the first puja we
wont have a long puja, we’ll have Ganesha’s

00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:52.920
Atharva Sheersha then maybe hundred and eight
names could be said.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:23.550
It’s not going to be very long puja, and
I think then you have to also go to Veru to

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.860
see … (Marathi or Hindi)…

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.529
I think you can go tomorrow to Veru.

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:38.070
See, it takes hardly about two hours or three
hours.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.350
Two hours at the most.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:57.139
And then you can go to Shrirampur.

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.600
You have to be ready tomorrow quite early
in the morning.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.230
Go and see Veru, which is about two hours’
journey from here, and then you can go to

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:11.450
Shrirampur where you can have your lunch,
rest there, in the evening there’s program

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.290
for you.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.100
I hope you enjoyed your visit to Ajanta.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:26.179
I was waiting for you here, then I had to
leave because you were very much delayed;

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:29.960
and I am sorry for what has happened in Malavathi,
that there was some inconveniences because

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.510
I was not there.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.620
Just imagine, if I am not in a place how things
go wrong!

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.620
I mean, I just start wondering what will happen
when I will not be there.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.620
So the commitment has to be there.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.620
That’s the main point is.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.650
…. I was thinking that you need not come
today to Aurangabad, because it’s quite

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.440
far away and then you have to go tomorrow
to Veru; so this is the place where they have

00:17:44.440 --> 00:18:02.900
arranged everything for you, so it’s better
that you stay here, there’s a beautiful

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.900
garden.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:14.660
You can have a look at the garden, then have
your food here and rest, and tomorrow morning

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.380
early in the morning if you can leave then
you can see Veru also and I’ll look after

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:17.430
the Aurangabad program, all right?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:06:02.300
Today 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.520
we have gathered here to do Guru puja.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.350
This system started long time back in India,
I think even at the time of Patanjali, maybe

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.860
even earlier, when there were great seekers.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:34.750
And their gurus were sitting in the jungles,
where they used to get permission to go there

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.789
and then they would get their realisation,
very few of them, one or two.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:47.430
So we had many rishis and munis in the olden
times in India.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.020
So this system of guru started.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.830
Also one of the reasons is that, that there
is no organised religion in India.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.300
There’s no popes, there are no priests,
nothing like them.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.550
They have priests just for worshipping in
the temples.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:23.950
But for giving realisation, for talking about
higher life, they all had to go to very great

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.860
realised souls.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:33.990
And it was absolutely the freedom of the guru,
whom to accept whom not to accept.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:44.889
And everybody was tested thoroughly by the
guru if they are capable of achieving Self-realisation

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.979
or not.

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:58.850
And this test was so hard, so difficult, and
also to a point of cruelty, that very few

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.889
could pass through that test.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:08.729
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:20.509
That, of course, made it a very narrow margin
for people to achieve their realisation and

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:26.490
these gurus never used to leave their own
seats, they call it takiya (meaning: pillow).

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.360
They would be there in their own place, all
those who would like to go to him could come.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.789
If he allowed, then only they can meet him.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.829
You may go on for miles together, nothing,
no obligations of the guru that he should

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:45.829
meet you.

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:58.830
Perhaps they didn’t feel that love and compassion
for the seekers.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:06.170
They didn’t understand that the seekers
are ardently seeking the truth and they should

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.260
not suffer.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.690
That may be the reason they were not so much
concerned.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.950
All the time they were testing their disciple.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:28.750
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.350
though he was a born realised.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:39.971
So to get this Gurupada, to the position of
a guru, after that they had to work very,

00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:46.860
very hard to achieve a state of a saint.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:53.860
But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case, as
you know.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:02.380
I just thought – if people get their realisation,
they’ll see for themselves what’s wrong

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:09.350
with them, they will introspect themselves
and will try to correct themselves.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:17.280
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind and are

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.540
going on and on and on thinking that they
are Sahaja Yogis, they have achieved a lot,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.350
they are something very special.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.540
So this delusion is all the time is creating
this problem.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:44.600
This delusion makes them very narrow minded,
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.089
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:56.839
So the first and foremost thing we have to
know that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out

00:10:56.839 --> 00:11:06.910
because Paramchaitanya is transmitting compassion,
It never did before, It never had that kind

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:14.040
of an attitude which it is there because I
am a Mother.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.360
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realisation, you

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.490
have achieved a state which we can call as
a Self-realised souls.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:35.620
But still, because you got it so easily, cheaply,
I think still we don’t realise what we have

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.640
got.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:48.480
Still we do not practice meditation, introspection
and dedication.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:57.610
Some are very much there, but mostly we are
just living in the idea that we have already

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.620
achieved.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:12.110
So, the first thing we should introspect:
Are we concerned about ourselves?

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:22.230
All the time do we think that we are suffering,
we have this problem, that problem, or this

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.810
should be done, that should be done.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:35.620
If the attention is on that, that all the
time you are worried about yourself, then

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:43.810
you cannot break, you cannot break through
this shell of your being, which is under the

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:52.429
domination of your mental selfishness or self-centredness.

00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:56.939
Even self-centredness is absolutely against
your growth.

00:12:56.939 --> 00:13:03.720
There are many people who come, I have seen,
even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.439
a lot because they think it’s a very open
space where they have to live and they must

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.740
make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.529
Such people have to grow still much more.

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:21.970
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:27.110
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.279
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:33.490
I have no demands of any kind.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:42.550
But if you are worried about your body comforts
or your body troubles then still you are at

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:48.050
a body level, which you have to transcend.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:58.420
Worried about how you look, how you dress
up, what sort of things you have to wear:

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:08.540
all this makes you yet not a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:15.220
This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still
want very great comforts.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:26.500
So, what you have to do, if you are used to
comforts: try to go and sleep on the street.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.240
I will not do that, but you can do it.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:38.889
Or sleep on a tree, you may fall down doesn’t
matter (laughter).

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:47.080
Do all kinds of things that are necessary
to punish your body to understand that you

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:54.070
are not bound with this comfort of the body.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:15:00.970
This is one of the greatest things one has
to see, that you are not bound by your body.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:06.690
It’s alright if you have comfort, well and
good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:14.190
For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important that
he should be able to live like a saint.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:24.060
Not necessarily that you should become a sanyasi,
but from inside your body should be such that

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.410
you can dominate your body.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.490
How can you not sleep anywhere?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.300
Why can you not sleep anywhere?

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:49.540
Then also, that they want to have a very comfortable
arrangements about bathrooms, this, that.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:56.100
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious but not superconsciousness,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.860
it’s not there.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.440
You want to have everything first class, and
anybody who tries to interfere with that kind

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.930
of a thing, you don’t like it.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:13.620
I can understand a person who is very old
– he cannot manage things, he has to have

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:27.389
a certain amount of body comfort, but even
young people these days are extremely comfort-oriented.

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:32.189
That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:37.839
Of course I’ve seen people in the West are
better off in this matter.

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:41.990
Because when they go to India they told Me
they like [Maharashtra] S.T.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.510
buses better than comfortable buses.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.380
So I said “Why?”

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:52.759
“Because Mother, you can jump in the bus
nicely with all the luggage,” (due to lack

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:55.790
of suspension and bumps in road) “Because
the windows are open, you can breathe.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.130
Very natural, very good“.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.019
And they wanted to go on bullock carts also.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:03.920
I mean they enjoy all that.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.230
Actually if you see you’ll notice, in the
Western World mostly, people are taking to

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.620
a more rustic life.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.380
They are enjoying more the rustic style of
life than to this so-called comfortable, artificial

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.380
life.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:25.250
Not so much Indians, I would say, also Malaysians.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:33.260
I think most of the people I have met in the
Western countries are really great because

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.100
they can sleep anywhere, they can eat anything.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.960
You ask them “How did you like the food?”

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.060
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.500
That is the sign.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:55.020
That is the sign of a person who is not bothered
as to what he is eating, what he’s getting,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:02.879
what is his taste, “I like this, I like
that,” these words drop out.

00:18:02.879 --> 00:18:12.570
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,
you might think that I am asking you to something,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.909
hazardous thing, you see.

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:18.820
It’s not difficult at all, because if you
have to impress the people around you, you

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.429
have to be like a saint.

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:29.980
And if you are a fussy person, if you are
a fusspot, then you cannot impress others

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.220
that you have got Self-realisation.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.250
Many people tell Me “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas, do this,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.190
do that, and then they got their realisation.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.930
How is it these people you have blessed?”

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.270
Even some great saints asked Me that.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.120
“What right they had to get their realisation?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.600
Why did you give them realisation?

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.700
What have they achieved?”

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.540
I said “Only their desire.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.190
Their desire was very much there that they
should get their Self-realisation and that’s

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.270
how they got it“.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:14.750
But now to go into only desire, is not sufficient.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:20.970
You have to depend on yourself, on the light
of your Spirit you should see what’s wrong

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.970
with you.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.110
This is a very important thing.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.100
Ask questions to yourself.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.590
“Why do I want this?

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.070
Why do I need this?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.159
What is the purpose?”

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:39.830
Because as you have seen, all the rest of
the world is mad, [we] call it mad, because

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:49.780
they are running after stupid things, they
are wanting things which has no meaning to

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.390
spirituality.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.320
So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.980
If you are spiritually endowed, then you are
self-satisfied.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:09.309
And this self-satisfaction within you will
lead you to that Ocean of Joy about which

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:15.059
I have been telling you and all the scriptures
have described.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:21.870
For Sahaja Yogis, the word we use is nirananda.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:26.860
Nirananda means: A joyous state, where nothing
is needed.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.679
Joy itself is joy.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:36.380
You are enjoying only joy.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.030
Nothing is needed to make you happy.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:48.220
You are happy because of joy that you have,
in the nirananda state.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.909
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed.

00:20:54.909 --> 00:21:00.340
How they managed their life, you’ll be very
much amazed.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.380
How many days they used to fast, without food.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.419
Never bothered!

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:05.890
They never thought it was fasting.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:11.210
They just used to think, “We have no food,
so no, don’t eat.”

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.110
Of course, you don’t have to go through
[that], you have got your realisation.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:20.190
So now you have a power to achieve this mastery.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.830
Now, you have this power.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:34.130
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some of them have grudges about others.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:48.970
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:22:04.000
There is no place for any kind of hatred,
or any kind of revenge, or anger among Sahaja

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.400
Yogis.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.600
If you have that, you must conquer it.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:17.929
Is a good chance, if you find somebody who
is very hot-tempered, who is a very angry

00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:23.120
type, go and make friends with that person.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.110
Just see if you can carry on with that person
or not.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:37.620
If there’s a fusspot, also make friends
with such a fusspot, and see that you achieve

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:45.110
that peace which will keep you above all kinds
of hatred, all kinds of temper, which is a

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.770
very bad thing.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.510
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper very
fast.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:59.659
I would say that they cannot be Sahaja Yogis,
because if you have no control over your anger,

00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:05.460
then how are you powerful of compassion and
love?

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.240
But you don’t even have to control it – just
there.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.820
Once you have it, or that state, then you
just watch and see.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:24.590
In the olden days, the saints ,mostly, used
to be very much angry type people.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:30.100
They couldn’t bear the stupidity of the
world and they used to be very, very angry

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.190
type and they used to run away from people.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:42.080
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who always
lived on the tree, and anybody tried to come

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.299
near him, he used to throw stones at.

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:52.210
Couldn’t bear the people who were all heated
up and coming to him.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:24:00.470
But you don’t need that, you have a way
of achieving love and affection of the people

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:07.960
who seem to be very, very troublesome and
grudging type or maybe some people who are

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.760
very aggressive.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.770
This is not a difficult task if you try a
little bit the other way round.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:20.909
Mostly people, when they find somebody who
is a very hot-tempered person, they run away

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:21.909
from them.

00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:25.169
They don’t want to have anything to do [with
them].

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:35.110
Those who are not hot-tempered, those who
are good nature, you can always be friendly,

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.440
what is so great about it?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.559
What is so nice about it?

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:50.830
What is so sweet about it?

00:24:50.830 --> 00:25:01.460
But how you speak to the person, how you talk
to that person, how you manage that person:

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.060
your love will definitely melt him down, because
he’s a Sahaja Yogi, I’m not saying for

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.350
non-sahaja yogis.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:19.360
Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:31.059
Another thing which is extremely important
for us to know, that we have got this realisation

00:25:31.059 --> 00:25:33.890
through Mother’s love.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:39.450
Only My compassion has acted, only the power
of Mother’s compassion could have worked

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.340
it out.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:51.570
Now, even if this love is flowing towards
the stones, or towards the mountains or towards

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:59.520
anything which is very solid, the ripples
come back, they have to come back.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.850
In the same way, you people now, who have
got realisation, have to know that compassion

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:12.990
and love is the only power you have got, nothing
else.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:21.679
If you love yourself, if you care for yourself,
you care for your family and care for your

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:25.710
children – then you haven’t achieved much.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:34.669
You’re only worried about yourself, because
that’s your limited area where you move.

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:48.250
But if you can break that and find out places
where you have to express your love, you can.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:52.559
As they say, the water finds it’s own level.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:27:00.640
In the same way, this compassion has to flow
to all the places, to all the ditches everywhere,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.760
and should find its own level.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:13.950
But if you are just satisfied with yourself
and you are not bothered, you are just trying

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:21.580
to believe that you are a great soul because,
you are a Sahaja Yogi, then I must say, that

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.049
you are sadly mistaken.

00:27:25.049 --> 00:27:29.310
In this lifetime, you can achieve that state.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:36.080
In this lifetime, you can get to that state
within yourself.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:44.880
Now, the third thing that troubles Sahaja
Yogis is that, “Mother we want God’s realisation,”

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.220
that makes Me laugh.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:53.019
You see, it is already there, already there.

00:27:53.019 --> 00:27:58.190
Like once you get into the sea and you say
“Mother, we want to go to the bottom of

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.549
the sea,” you can always go, just slip,
and you will be there.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:12.340
In the same way, once you have developed a
kind of a Self-realisation and have jumped

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:19.730
into the ocean of this compassion, there’s
no need to achieve anything.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:25.090
The sense of achievement, “I should be that,
I should be this,” is all coming from your

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.269
human haunting.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:29.269
That should be over.

00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:31.559
Now you are Godly people.

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:35.960
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.370
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads and

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.769
it will work out.

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:54.779
This is what I have been saying to you that:
you have to dissolve yourself into the compassion.

00:28:54.779 --> 00:29:03.720
Also, there are still very people who want
to be in the front.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.140
Specially Indians will all sit together in
front, I’ve seen that way.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:15.340
They have no right, they have no right to
sit in front.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:21.169
Nobody has right to sit in front or to seek
a place.

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:28.480
They should sit wherever they get seat to
sit down with complete satisfaction.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:38.110
Whether you sit in front or at that corner,
even in the darkness, you can get My vibrations,

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.299
you can get everything.

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:49.669
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary.

00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:53.480
What is it in a prominence, what do you get?

00:29:53.480 --> 00:30:00.870
To be lost into the crowds, to be lost into
the Ocean of Love is the main thing.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:10.190
All these are mythical that, we should somehow
or other get the front place.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:22.340
You see as Marathi apan manto (We say), “Samor
chi zaaga patkauli mi!” means “I have

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.920
managed to get the front seat!”

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.909
Front will be the back, and back will be the
front.

00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:43.830
It is very surprising how still people are
trying to achieve something so nonsensical.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:49.419
So where is your mind, where is your attention,
what are you thinking?

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:57.179
If you are thoughtless you will be satisfied,
you will be happy, you will not ask for anything,

00:30:57.179 --> 00:31:00.110
you’ll not want anything.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.710
What is there to have?

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.139
What is so important?

00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:11.150
All these ideas come from ignorance, I must
tell you, from ignorance.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.370
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:21.930
And he said that “We have heard you are
a great saint, this thing, that thing, and

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:27.510
you have all the comforts of life – you
have everything here, very nice, this thing,

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.900
that.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.510
So, how are you a saint?”

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.750
I said “How are you a saint?”

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:41.960
[He said] “I have given up my family, I
have given up my cars, I have given up my

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:47.250
house, I have given up my children.”

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:54.460
I said “One more thing you have given up”,
he said “What?”

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.570
I said “Your brains!!”

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:04.630
(laughter and applause) So he said, “How
do you say we have given up our brains?”

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:11.250
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up nothing,
because I am holding nothing!

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.880
What is there to give up when you are not
holding anything?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:22.720
Now, I would say in this house, or on my body,
anywhere, [if] you think you can find anything

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:32.690
equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna,
you can take it.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.570
Should be equal though.”

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.770
Now they started looking here and there.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.350
I said “Then what have you given up?

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.350
Just stones?

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.850
What have you given?

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:48.760
Why are you boasting about giving up that,
and giving up this and giving up…?”

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.860
They even shaved their head.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:59.140
All these useless ideas, that “We have done
this, we have done that.”

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.650
Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks he is doing
a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga, should give

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:03.650
up completely!

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:11.039
That’s the sign of another ignorance.

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:17.450
If you are part and parcel of the Ocean, everything
is done by Ocean, you are doing nothing.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:26.919
To have such ideas about yourself shows how
little you know about your Self.

00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:28.419
You are the Ocean.

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:33.380
And if you are the Ocean how can you claim
“I’ve touched this shore, I have touched

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.630
that shore, I have touched this shore“?

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.440
No more “I” is left.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:49.100
Once this I-ness drops out then only the Universal
Being within you shines.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:34:00.149
All these things are so clearly evident in
our characters.

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:09.069
Some people are very identified, say with
their country, or maybe with their worshipping

00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:12.899
style, whatever it is.

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:16.649
All these mis-identifications have to be given
up.

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:22.389
It is very difficult for people because they
are so conditioned, and as long as you have

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:30.630
conditioning you cannot rise above your mind,
which is a myth, you cannot.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:40.980
Now, try to understand, what your conditionings
are.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:47.950
One of them, I would say, I have seen and
I am so surprised, you go to the Western countries,

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:52.470
all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.450
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:35:00.509
Shri Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also.

00:35:00.509 --> 00:35:03.400
And now I have seen that vibrations stop!

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400
Why should they stop?

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.410
Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations?

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:13.390
Why they are doing it, I realised, was because
I said Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:23.170
Their identification is with Christ and Christianity,
in a very subtle way.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:24.800
So all the vibrations stopped!

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:33.560
Imagine with Shri Ganesha’s music, we heard
in one of the Eastern Block countries, and

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:39.290
all the vibrations had stopped and they were
singing all the songs of Shri Ganesha and

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:48.330
not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone about
the Guru, not once.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:56.569
So, even there is a very subtle identification.

00:35:56.569 --> 00:36:06.750
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed to
be very intelligent, he said that “Alright,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:13.240
if we keep Mother’s photograph and also
the icons, we can get the same type of vibrations.”

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:20.710
You cannot, because icons are made by some
artist’s imaginary.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:28.990
These are not representing actually even Maria
or Christ or anyone, they are all imaginary.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:37.850
If Italian ones make Christ, he is Italian
style, if some French one makes it, he is

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:45.930
thin like French, if you get somebody say
from Holland, he will have a forehead like

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.930
that.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:56.620
You see all of them they depict Christ as
they want to.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:05.380
Then we have Maria the same way, Her expression,
her photograph, everything, is all according

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:13.960
to the imagination of the artist and to whatever
country he belongs, that he will do.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.921
And they are not free, you can see they are
not free, because all these artists have a

00:37:18.921 --> 00:37:20.120
certain style.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:28.400
Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s a style, if
it is, say Leonardo, it’s a style.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.030
Though they are born realised, still they
have a style.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:39.520
Nobody is like this, that he’ll make today
like this, tomorrow like that: there’s no

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.520
freedom.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.569
They are bound by their own styles.

00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:49.339
Everybody has one style, and that is the style
they follow.

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:56.609
Because, what is the reason, the reason is,
they must have done 3 or 4 types of styles,

00:37:56.609 --> 00:38:02.660
they must have done, surely, but people must
have rejected, “This is no good, this is

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:08.510
no good,” so it is all the opinion of the
people.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.390
So they must have taken to one style: alright
this is the style.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:22.600
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes, if he’s Chinese,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:29.140
he’ll have no nose, if it’s Indian, he’ll
be dark.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:36.609
So all kinds of Christs I have seen and I
feel that, how can they emit vibrations?

00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:38.510
Tell me.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.600
While with my photograph, how can you compare?

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.810
Also, cameras were to be developed at this
time: do you notice that point?

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:54.299
Cameras were developed at this time, not before
that.

00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:58.510
This loudspeaker was not developed before
this.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.560
Aeroplanes were not developed before.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:09.420
I have been travelling for 19 days, one day
in the plane, second day in the public programme.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.560
They could not do all that.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.670
Nobody could do this.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.200
Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.230
They could not fly by aeroplane in those days.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:28.650
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries” or go

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.650
on correcting.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.190
But is only possible because today, today:
there are aeroplanes.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:38.190
They were never there [before].

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:47.520
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there, was

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.069
that available before?

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:51.069
No.

00:39:51.069 --> 00:40:00.020
So this is a very special time, where science
has also supported seekers to find the Truth

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.020
– science has supported.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:09.510
We have to be thankful to science: that part
of science which has been so much supportive.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:15.640
Even [if] there was not a car, I could not
have gone up to Milan even!

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.799
Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would
have happened to Me?

00:40:19.799 --> 00:40:27.110
So all these things are created today for
you.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:33.600
You were also born in those times for the
special reason.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.640
They could not give realisation because that
time you were not there.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.640
Very few people of your calibre were there.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.750
But I wonder if you understand your calibre.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:56.440
The way you are sometimes growing, shows that
you don’t understand your calibre.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:06.150
You don’t know what you are, how much the
whole atmosphere has worked out for you, the

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.569
science has been worked out for you.

00:41:09.569 --> 00:41:12.760
Science is a gift of the nature.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:23.020
All this has been worked out for you to achieve
the highest state in the shortest time.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:32.359
But for that, one has to be extremely introspecting.

00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:37.910
Instead of thinking of what you have to achieve:
be introspective!

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:46.020
This introspection will help you and you will
really become real gurus.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:55.170
When you go to other villages, other places,
other cities, people should know from your

00:41:55.170 --> 00:42:00.600
being itself that some great person has come.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:10.330
You don’t have to tell, you don’t have
to certify, it’s the simplicity of your

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.309
temperament itself.

00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:17.920
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew
about Me.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:26.480
No advertisements, nothing, They just put
some posters, some.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.779
And there were 2,000 people in the hall, 2,000
outside.

00:42:29.779 --> 00:42:32.940
In the hall they had to pay, alright.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.480
I was wondering what’s the matter.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.510
And when I came out I gave them realisation
but I said “You come tomorrow“.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:48.049
So 2,000 from inside and 2,000 from outside
and about 2,000 more came, and we were all

00:42:48.049 --> 00:42:49.339
sitting on the ground.

00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:52.010
I was amazed.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.630
I said “What made you come to my programme?”

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:03.150
[They] said “Mother, it’s so obvious,
your photograph!”

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:10.750
Such sensitivity of spirituality: “So obvious,
from your photograph!”

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:16.300
And they were scientists, they were doctors,
they were all kinds of intelligent people.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:23.420
But they could feel the spirituality from
the face.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.460
That kind of a sensitivity we should have.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.660
When you don’t need any discretion, nothing,
you know: this is this, this is this, this

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.029
is this.

00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:39.710
Don’t have to judge, don’t have to think
about it.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:49.590
You cannot say who will be best fitted for
this: those who have come for the first time,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:56.381
those who have come later on or those who
will be coming, younger or older, women, men

00:43:56.381 --> 00:43:59.960
or children.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.960
It is there.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:10.609
In my lifetime if I see so many of you, so
much transformed, looking so beautiful, so

00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:14.609
nice, creating such a good atmosphere.

00:44:14.609 --> 00:44:18.390
It’s more than satisfaction for Me.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.730
And sometimes I think there is nothing to
be done now anymore – finished.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:28.480
But then they invite Me here, and invite Me
there, so I’m just doing.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.080
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.460
Now, once you have planted the tree…it’s
like a mango tree.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:44.280
Once you have planted a mango tree and looked
after it for 3 or 4 years, then it looks after

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280
itself.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:52.630
It gives fruits, it doesn’t need any water,
nothing, it just grows by itself.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:56.290
In the same way it should happen with you.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.380
You should grow by yourself.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:08.040
Of course, you will find people who are stupid,
who are aggressive, who are not at all Sahaja

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.680
Yogis and trying to be Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.860
You’ll find all kinds.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:20.089
So just see them, that’s all.

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:30.739
In this Guru puja, you have to decide that
what are the criteria.

00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:45.010
First a Guru has to be without desires, any
desires whatsoever: nirichcha as they say.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:53.170
There is one false guru in India who said
that ” If I had the powers as Mother has,

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.300
then I would have become the king of this
world“.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.000
So people said “Then why don’t you become?”

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.660
Why doesn’t Mother become like that?

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.509
Why doesn’t She become the king?”

00:46:07.509 --> 00:46:09.710
So they said “Because She is nirichcha-
means She has no desires.

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:12.280
A person who has no desires will not become
anything.”

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:18.420
So, I said go and tell him “If you have
desires, you cannot have powers also.”

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:27.620
It’s only because you have no desires, that’s
why all these powers are there.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:37.210
So any desire that comes in your mind, you
should say “Forget it, just forget it.”

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:46.560
When the desire is overpowering, you just
divert your attention.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:57.270
Any kind of stupid desire can take charge
and how do you become desireless is by getting

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.549
to the thoughtless awareness.

00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:06.620
Any crisis comes in, you should be able to
rise into that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.739
Just be peaceful.

00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:10.910
Look at your desires with peace.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:19.739
You can tell the desire, “Oh, I’m very
much satisfied, now don’t come, I don’t

00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:20.739
want.”

00:47:20.739 --> 00:47:24.280
That’s how you can become desireless.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:34.770
There is this compassion, and the compassion
that becomes actually the power.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:46.350
[With] small, small things you can express
your love, very small, small things.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:52.719
In very sweet ways, you can express your love..

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:53.719
Is very important.

00:47:53.719 --> 00:47:57.880
The whole world needs today love and peace.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:05.859
And you have to give peace and love to everyone
that is possible.

00:48:05.859 --> 00:48:11.080
Of course [with] Sahaja Yogis it is very easy,
but even non Sahaja Yogis, you must treat

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:19.460
them with respect and love, but you should
not have a desire that you should get back

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.290
anything from them.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.730
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:30.550
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga have gained so much and have

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:35.710
betrayed us – it doesn’t matter, it’s
not important.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:40.410
Because they are going to be losers, not we.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:46.780
So, there’s nothing to bother about these
things.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:52.960
Then another thing is: try to see that your
mind doesn’t react.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:59.100
Some people have a habit, or I think most
of them have, to react.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:04.819
You tell them something and they’ll put
their own one tail with it, something.

00:49:04.819 --> 00:49:10.730
Never will they accept if somebody says something.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.800
If you are reacting, what will go into your
heads?

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.319
What will go into your heart?

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:20.400
What will go into your attention?

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:28.460
So the reaction itself is a sign of not proper
development within yourself.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:34.950
This attention which is trying to go into
all the areas of your mind and your body and

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.210
everywhere, is not there.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:47.400
It cannot enter, because as soon as it tries
to enter, you shut it by reacting.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.480
You cannot see anything just for seeing sake,
you must react.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.699
You say “This is not good, that’s not
good.”

00:49:54.699 --> 00:49:58.890
If I say “It is 5 o’clock” you’ll
say “No!

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:05.900
It is 5 past, 2 minutes, 3 seconds!”

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:11.359
This comes with terrible conditioning which
has to go away.

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.630
Not to react.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.170
Why should you react?

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:24.640
Then the argument starts, then fight starts,
then wars come in.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.359
If you tell your mind, “Nothing doing, you
are a myth and I am not going to react to

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.319
anything!”

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:33.290
99.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:43.140
9% problems will be solved.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.109
Then the last, but not the least is the ego.

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:58.180
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,
just can’t understand.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:04.020
It’s so stupid to have ego.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:13.622
It’s a kind of a domination, if slightest
things are wrong, you get angry.

00:51:13.622 --> 00:51:16.570
If somebody says something, you get angry.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:26.109
That means your power of love and compassion
is still not full.

00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:32.850
You can of course correct people when they
have to be corrected but for that you should

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.580
have this power within yourself.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:44.300
The person should know that you are correcting
that person because you love that person,

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.890
not for selfishness, not for any gain.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:57.179
But this ego is a very big problem and that
comes up by, I should say, not only ignorance

00:51:57.179 --> 00:52:04.020
but stupid ideas about yourself.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:12.400
If you think you are something great, already,
then what can you do?

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.880
Ego makes you very arrogant, horrible.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:24.170
But if you are humble, really, not to just
to have the humility of a businessman, but

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:36.480
if you are humble from within yourself, from
your heart, enjoying your humility, then this

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.680
ego can run away.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.380
You have to ask yourself “Now what are you
angry for?”

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:47.600
Again, I come back to the same point: introspection.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:57.430
Because you are not here just to carry on
some jobs, but you are here to become saints.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:07.460
Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of love and joy.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.130
You can, it is not difficult.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:18.989
This one is what is ego is, reactions to things.

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:26.480
You can react to things in a sweet way or
you can react to things in a deadly way.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.280
Then the humour comes in.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:42.359
Also you speak as if there is fragrant flowers
which are coming out.

00:53:42.359 --> 00:53:49.160
Then every action of yours, everything becomes
very gentle and sweet.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:58.870
Have this ego that will be gentle, will be
kind, will be sweet, will be forgiving, will

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:59.880
be loving.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.730
Let’s have this ego.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.980
Start with this kind of a ego – the other
way round.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:12.390
You’ll be surprised how you can really conquer
the whole world.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:21.660
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is supposed
to tell something to his disciples about correcting

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.050
themselves.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:27.049
In my own sweet way I’ve said to you which
you shouldn’t mind.

00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:35.290
I don’t mean to condemn you by any chance
but to give you a proper sense of introspection,

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:42.219
proper sense of introspection by which you
all get your gurupada.

00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:49.750
My only, I shouldn’t say desire, because
I don’t have desire.

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:57.631
So my only vision is, that I should see all
the Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of

00:54:57.631 --> 00:55:10.040
love, enjoying each others love, enjoying
each others relationship, and improving relationships.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.640
I know there are problematic people, I know
they are problematic, but if you cannot solve

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:22.680
the problem what’s the use of your become
masters?

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:37.770
So, I leave it to you to solve your own problems
which you are facing, and introspection with

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:42.779
love and compassion, not by condemning yourself.

00:55:42.779 --> 00:57:36.690
I am sure you can manage it.

00:57:36.690 --> 02:38:15.029
May God bless you.

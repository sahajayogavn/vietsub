00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.600
It’s so very joyous to see you all here
assembled together.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.220
I’ve to thank you very much for getting
such a nice place as this Shudy Camp; I’ve

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.640
given it a new name, Shoody Camp meaning cleansing
camp 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.860
which is such an ancient building.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:45.539
It has gone through various stages of history
and has kept the mark of all these times and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:58.449
now you have to build up the future on this
land, on this spot, in this building.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:08.520
Also I’m thankful to you for buying such
a nice comfortable car for Me.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.300
I thought I was supposed to buy but everybody
said, “No, we are supposed to buy it for

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.910
You, Mother.”

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:24.150
This is the first house that is in My name,
first house I own and this is the first car

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:34.620
I have owned in My name.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:48.450
I’m so proud that My children have bought
it for Me.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:02:00.350
They have, with their love and affection have
bought this huge big place as well as the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.660
car for My dwelling as well as for My comfort.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:30.280
When we come on this earth, when the incarnations
descend they don’t need a building at all;

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:44.380
they have a dwelling that’s &lt;inaudible &gt; face
the sky and the clouds are the curtains and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:54.530
grass is their bed and all the directions
are the worms.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.329
But when they reside in the heart of their
children, in the heart of their bhaktas, the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:40.409
heart of their devotees, then these beautiful
hearts create something so artistic 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:59.549
and then re-creates according to his own 
expression of love.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:14.030
This is what you have done by buying this
house and by buying this car, amen.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:22.919
I don’t need any conveyance, you know that.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:33.860
But in the modern times the conveyance has
changed.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:58.150
It started with a little mouse, changing into
a car, maybe an aeroplane.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:11.860
But actually what is My conveyance is?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:24.919
My conveyance is your heart, only through
your heart I can be carried.

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:34.400
There’s no other way out.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:48.330
Your sincerity, your devotion, your love,
that can only carry your Mother and this is

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:58.460
a symbol of that.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.300
Matter has only one facility that you can
express your heart through these material

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.300
things.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:24.930
Your nobility, your graciousness, your generosity
is expressed through matter.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:38.380
I do that Myself and now you have done it
this time; I’m thankful to you.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:53.169
As you know very well that I cannot be contained
into anything, neither in this house, neither

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:59.300
in England nor in India, nor in the whole
universe.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:10.120
I’m rather too large, but of course in your
heart, I can.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:17.150
And that is how your heart should be.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:35.910
For Me, a comfortable place like a lotus to
relax, to realize My own love.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:08:02.680
When all these things happen, so much adoration
is poured on your Mother you just get boundless;

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:33.490
you spread out, you reach such spots in the
whole of humanity, everywhere I can feel the

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:48.170
worship, the enjoyment of millions of millions
who died before, who are there and who will

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.010
be there.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:09:24.450
All this expands you into a very subtle sensibility
of feeling every suffering soul, every tortured

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:42.550
person, every unhappy being, every seeker,
every Sahaja Yogi all over the world.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:48.260
In you I see their reflection.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:57.970
In the same way you all have to expand, expand
yourself, that’s very important for England.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:09.339
As I said, England is the heart and the spirit
resides in the heart but spirit moves out

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:15.990
of the heart sometimes, it does.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:26.660
And is reflected through the soul and recently
I told in Italy that Italy is the soul.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:34.940
That’s why you have to go by a special plane
to Italy to reflect.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.070
But now Italians have come here.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:45.290
The soul had to come to the spirit.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:50.510
So let us not be materialistic, for a change.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:11:14.100
Let us not be mundane but work out your spiritual
hankering through its fulfillment.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:27.750
You have seen, so many in India, Ajanta, which
was built in eleven centuries, which is built

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:39.310
in a range of half-circular mountains.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:49.649
The stones were hewed from top to bottom and
the height of some of these is more than eighty

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:57.779
feet, the caves and in eleven centuries how
they worked it out, that first they made a

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:59.709
general plan of it.

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:08.339
Then they made the division of it, like that
it went on till it came to the detailed working.

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:17.850
Generations after generations, in the praise
of Lord Buddha whom they had not seen, they

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.510
had never known, only in dedication to Him.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:33.870
They worked in that jungle, in that forest,
day in and day out, for eleven centuries to

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:42.470
build that Ajanta where even their names are
not there; no one knows who were responsible,

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.010
who did it.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:52.630
Without leaving any traces, just for their
emancipation, of expression of their adoration

00:12:52.630 --> 00:13:03.350
for Lord Buddha because He talked of self-realization;
only talked, didn’t give.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:11.310
For eleven generations or may be more because
in one century there are at least two generations;

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:17.339
maybe twenty-one generations worked, one after
another to build that huge thing of seven

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:21.130
miles.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:32.250
And the whole thing is so smooth, like this,
like the tent that the roof is extremely smooth,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:44.029
as if a tent has been put up, and even there
is this kind of a looseness, that you can

00:13:44.029 --> 00:14:01.630
see in this tent and when the wind blows,
how the cloth goes into folds with all the

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:07.339
beautiful paintings on them, is shown.

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:14.250
What was it that made it?

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.819
Who was the one who guided them?

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:29.310
They had never seen Buddha.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:35.540
We have got realization, we’re much higher
people than all of them.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.360
We have much more capacities.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:49.730
Now in Delhi they have discovered that Sahaja
Yogis have a greater resistance for digestion,

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:56.570
skin resistance and when they’re in thoughtless
awareness there are no electrical charges

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.250
in the brain.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:11.540
So their brains are preserved and are going
to be very dynamic for a long time.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:24.800
It’s going to be published on the eighth
of this month.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:36.110
So one has to know that we are born in a very
dynamic time, historical times.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:44.750
Never before in history we had so many Sahaja
Yogis.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:52.480
This is the time of the greatest revolution,
greatest evolution 

00:15:52.480 --> 00:16:00.880
and this is the time you’re going to achieve
something that was never achieved before.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:10.649
Are we capable of calling ourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:20.110
August is a very great month, specially for
Me.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.670
Today is also a very great day, I should say.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:34.600
In the month of August, we got our independence,
as you know, ninth of August, in India.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:46.370
But before that, in 1942, on the third of
August, Mahatma Gandhi declared the movement

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:52.490
of “Quit India,” of the British from India.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:17:18.920
And today on the same day you have welcomed
Me in the heart of the heart, Shoody Camp.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:48.400
Eighth of August, as you know, is the day
when Rabindranath Tagore was born and in our

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.600
college we celebrated eighth of August and
I remember it very clearly.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:12.360
And the ninth 
of August we all went on a strike.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:21.640
In science college I remember I was a young
girl of nineteen years and My professsor and

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.950
My principal still remember all those things
that happened.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:32.900
I was standing alone and behind Me were all
the students who were doing the strike.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:39.150
When the military came in and they tried to
threaten and do all kinds of things to Me.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.540
I said, “No, we’ll not enter into the
college, today is the strike day.”

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.340
When My principal came and he was very happy
and they removed him for that.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:54.360
He has written a very nice letter to Me when
he met Me the other day, when he saw Me as

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.690
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.890
It was a letter worth really remembering.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:08.840
So this is the month of a very big change
and revolution in India.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:18.900
But with that one has to remember that “Quit
India” movement started all right and all

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:27.260
kinds of sacrifices were done, people sacrificed
so much that you cannot imagine how much people

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.100
have to sacrifice.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:36.780
As today in South Africa, people are sacrificing
so much for their freedom, much worse than

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.730
in India, much worse.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.310
People sacrificed and sacrificed.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:53.610
As a result of those sacrifices, we got our
independence and we have to thank the Labour

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.220
government for that.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:04.650
If Mr. Attlee was not chosen by the Divine
we would never have got our independence.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:11.720
We got our independence and graciously English
left us, that was something really great of

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.730
them, in those days to do it.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:24.059
But that independence was just a political
independence, political freedom but today

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:30.540
you have the ultimate, ultimate freedom.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:38.030
You got the freedom of your spirit which is
not attached to anything, which is not anything

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:45.799
but the spirit, which is absolute, which is
neither English nor Indian nor Australian,

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:53.980
which is not this house, which is not anything
but the spirit itself, the complete freedom

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.210
you’ve got.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.950
In that freedom you have to rise.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:09.030
Still we have considerations of brothers,
sisters, children, wife; no, you are the spirit.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.030
You have to sacrifice.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:15.730
For Me, nothing is like sacrificing because
I don’t know what am I sacrificing.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:31.190
In the same way what we call sacrifice at
that stage should be Sahaj now for us, Sahaj.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.000
That time it was a sacrifice but today it
should be Sahaj.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.860
We’ve gained so much in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.020
In that freedom fight, they gained nothing.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.520
But what are we sacrificing?

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:57.140
Just our ego and this is what English have
to come up to.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.070
“What have I sacrificed for Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.820
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.530
How much I have exploited it?”

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:12.260
We must think it over; it’s very important.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:20.860
You left an empire; India was the gem.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.330
On that earning you are still having your
doles today.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.330
Such a rich country you left, richest of all
in the whole world was India.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:41.500
You don’t know how rich India was and is
today even if you see to it.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.960
And you left that country, you are a small
country.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:54.520
You don’t have any riches as such, nothing,
but in your greatness you left it.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.010
Nobody will leave like that.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.480
Your forefathers did it.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:11.580
It’s a great sacrifice I think, from the
worldly point of view.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:18.390
So we have to now understand that, we must
have confidence in ourselves in such a way

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.030
that whatever we sacrifice, what do we sacrifice?

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:29.740
In this maya you sacrifice something and how
much you get out of it.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.030
Just the maya is testing you.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:47.940
So for today you have sacrificed a lot, given
lot of money to have this house, and I know

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.940
that.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:54.220
You’ll be amazed I’m not worried about
My own money, how much it is spent here and

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.220
there.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:02.770
But for your money I’m very hard on all
of them and the leaders might be thinking

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:11.480
I’m so miserly but this is public money,
not only public, this is the blood of My children.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:24.710
So again on this great occasion, this joyous
occasion, in the month of August we’re having

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:34.180
this beautiful place now and with this one
we’ll have many in future.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:43.110
I hope we’ll occupy the whole place quite
a lot.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:55.679
Already the neighbors must have run away 

00:24:55.679 --> 00:25:07.870
and we’re going to manage somehow or other
to purchase all these places here.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.279
You have to desire it.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:20.040
Behind every desire there has to be the action
and in that action you have to sacrifice.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.950
But if you say it laboriously, “I’m sacrificing,
sacrificing,” it’s not a divine thing

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:31.320
to do, should be done in such a joyous way.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:43.400
I hope now, today you will all promise Me
that every morning you’re going to meditate,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:49.220
every morning, everyone, no excuses, you’re
not going to excuse yourself.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.330
Unless and until you meditate I cannot do
what I want to do in Shoody Camp.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:26:04.060
No laziness, no excuses, no telling lies,
not deceiving yourself; all of you are going

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:10.179
to meditate, that is one promise.

00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:18.840
And the rest I’ll look after, the rest I
will look after.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:27.799
You’ll just decide to meditate everyday,
everyday.

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:35.180
That’s one more thing you have to give Me
is the promise that you will all meditate

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:41.860
everyday in the morning time and evening time
if you do foot-soaking is good for you, not

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.549
for Me.

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:58.760
Everything’s so spontaneous, so beautiful,
how it has worked out.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:04.480
Now to end it up I’ll give you a very good
example of manifestation of another miracle

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.730
that has taken place, how it works out.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.890
You know we have bought a plot of land of
forty-two acres in Vaitarna for the education

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.490
of children.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:29.140
And the Bombay people went there and planted
some three hundred trees and also they had

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.100
a paddy farming started there.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.230
Before the school starts they thought something
should be done about it.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.880
But the villagers around would bring their
cattle, their cows, and their goats and all

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.799
of them to graze in that ground.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:51.450
So they got very much worried and the Sahaja
Yogis in Vaitarna also said that, “You shouldn’t

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.070
this, this is Mother’s land.”

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:59.250
Again they had a meeting of the villagers,
they told, “This is Mother’s land, you

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.850
better not come here.”

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.110
They wouldn’t listen to them.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:13.710
And one day suddenly in the daytime a very
big tiger appeared, very big tiger, of a very

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.159
large size.

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:22.240
And he started roaring and jumping all over,
running all over the place whatever we had

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.279
purchased and all that.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:30.940
And everyday he did it for five days and they
got such a fright that they took away their

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.029
lock, stock and barrel, as you say, and everything.

00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:43.830
Their cattle and their everything they took
away, tied it together and all of them.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:49.929
They’ve also removed their huts, I’m told,
they’re so frightened.

00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:56.549
And this tiger is nobody else but is Bhairavanathji.

00:28:56.549 --> 00:29:04.720
He does that and you know that He’s St.
George who’s working so very hard.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:10.570
Nobody has seen a tiger there the last thirty
years and that area is not known at all for

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:30.830
tigers and such a big tiger, they said.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.570
So thank you very much, may God bless you.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:41.170
Now if you want to give Me flowers you can
do that and also I would request you to have

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.919
your food, it’s very late already.

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:49.590
And do you want to have some music or something
after that?

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:55.380
You can have, what’s the harm?

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.490
You could have your food here if you like.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.911
It’s quite a warm place isn’t it?

00:29:58.911 --> 00:29:59.911
Is there a heater here?

00:29:59.911 --> 00:30:00.911
No?

00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:01.911
You all should freeze in this place.

00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:02.911
There are so many sayings in English language,
if you just pay attention to it.

00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:03.911
One of them is: oranges and lemons, sold for
a penny; that’s for our, you see, treatment,

00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:04.911
with the lemons we have.

00:30:04.911 --> 00:30:05.911
And there’s another one: London Bridge is
falling down, suggesting that what we believe

00:30:05.911 --> 00:30:06.911
into, all these bridges is not important.

00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:15.400
The bridge with God has to be built and expressing
that material things should fall down.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.400
And then: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400
There are so many things that explain that
people knew what it was going to be.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400
It’s so surprising that there’s a poet
called Lewis.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400
He has written, I don’t know if you have
read it or not, have you brought that?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400
I wish you had.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400
About the procession he saw in India of you
people, you haven’t got it?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400
How many of you have read that?

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400
That’s very exclusive!

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400
Surprising, nobody has that.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400
All right, tomorrow.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Remember all that you have to get from there.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.400
Mr. Djamel has to bring many things, I think.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.400
Also there’s a Commonwealth meeting going
on, better give bandhan, specially to our

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400
Indian Prime Minister who is a realized soul
and they were telling Me that all the terrorists

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.400
have joined together to kill him.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.400
And our High Commissioner also, his wife told
Me that all the terrorists have arrived.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.400
Do you know in London, who rules?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400
St. George.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400
How dare anybody touch that.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400
St. George rules there, so we don’t need
a tiger.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400
It’s all right, He’s already there, settled
down.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.400
Thank you very much, all these and I went
to…, beautiful, all right.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400
These are all wild flowers, you’ll be amazed
the country has such an abundance of these

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.400
wonderful flowers and so unique.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.400
See this one is Ganesha’s flower here, see
this one is the wild flower, you like to see?

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.400
Such beautiful flowers, see this one, two
colors of Ganesha.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400
And they last and last, you see, they don’t
need much water, nothing, keep them and they

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.400
last and last.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400
Exactly four.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400
See how beautiful they are.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:45.402
It’s beautiful.

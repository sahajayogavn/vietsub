00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:07.809
This has been the month of warnings somehow,
because certain things I’ve been seeing

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:24.609
in people how it happens and, how people get
into problems, how our inner being is disturbed,

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:33.780
and why sometimes Sahaja Yoga fails within
you.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.360
One must understand the dangers we face as
human beings.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.810
No doubt you are the highest of this creation,
no doubt.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.020
For you this Universe was created, for you
this Earth was created, no doubt.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:02.640
And today you are at a situation where you
have to get out of this illusion.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.520
The time has come, everything is right.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.180
But on a tree if you notice the most delicate
stage is that of a flower.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.940
Flower is the most delicate thing.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:26.470
The roots are tough, extremely tough: they
penetrate through the land, hardest possible

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.480
land; they go through different rocks and
find their ways.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.060
But when it comes to the flower stage, it’s
a very, very, delicate stage: though the whole

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.210
creation just waits for that time.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.680
The whole tree works it out, and the tree
creates that beautiful flower.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.880
It’s waiting for that time, that blossom
time, when the flowers have to become the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
fruit.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.860
Now that is the time, that precarious time,
that beautiful time, that fantastic, dynamic

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.770
time is.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.220
But we do not know how delicate it is, and
that’s how, we really play too much with

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.260
ourselves.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:32.800
Before realisation, you have seen people who
have come to Me who had terrible mental problems;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.240
who were mentally deranged people absolutely,
epileptic and of serious type.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.130
They got cured, they got their realisation,
they settled back.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.310
You have seen people with cancer, with blood
cancer, all kinds of physical troubles: they

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.600
got their blessings, they got their realisation,
they have settled back.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.820
You have seen people from very false gurus
who have damaged their being completely, who

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.100
have been mesmerised, who have been absolutely
misled and lynched and have been made into

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.550
you can say just cabbages.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.410
Such people also came to Sahaja Yoga and tried
and prospered.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.900
But again it’s the flower stage one must
not forget, and that is the time one has to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.840
be very careful.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.960
At the blossom time only, imagine, the times
are so precarious that the gardener has to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:45.000
worry that there should not be a hailstorm!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.170
And all the satanic forces have worked up
in their fullest form, with their greatest

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:02.790
strength, with all their tricks and methods,
to curb down the progress of this creation

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.150
into its fruitful happening.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:18.540
At such [a] precarious time one has to be
very aware of all the dangers that we can

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.450
face.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.040
The greatest danger comes to people when,
after getting realisation also, they do not

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.850
have faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.330
It’s the greatest danger, because that’s
your anchorage, that’s the way you are saved.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:49.230
Say if there’s a boat, which comes for your
rescue, and you are drowning and it rescues

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.010
you, you see it, you can feel it.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.590
Those who have not felt, alright, but those
who have felt it, you come off the boat and

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.610
then you do not believe in the boat, you do
not have faith in boat, that’s the greatest

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.540
danger you face.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:14.550
People have faith in all kinds of nonsense
very easily, but to believe that you have

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.450
found the Reality, to believe that you can
be saved, is very difficult for people who

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.620
are all the time drowned and are threatened
and frightened.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:42.910
Because the habit is formed to be always drowned,
harassed, haunted, by fears.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.520
So that habit doesn’t go and that comes
over and you feel frightened and you lose

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.230
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.840
Whether you have faith in it or not, it works.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.590
It works on people who do not even have faith.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.220
Today only I received a very interesting letter
from India and a man who is suppose to be

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.340
something big there.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:12.500
He told Me he read an advertisement about
Me, that Mataji is going to give realisation

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.010
through Kundalini awakening, and he just came
just to make fun of the whole thing, to the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.010
program.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.100
And there he felt that I was just befooling
people, it is not possible, he sat with a

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.680
very skeptical ideas.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:36.040
But his Kundalini rose and he felt the cool
breeze and he felt that calm and everything,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040
he was amazed.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.500
I don’t remember, he relays that I came
to him and he said, “Mother you are so kind.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.900
Despite the fact I came with this kind of
idea you gave me realisation.”

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.690
Because Indians know what realisation means,
here people even don’t know that, so the

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.020
situation is much worse.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.920
They know that realisation means cool breeze,
it means you must get cool breeze flowing

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920
from you.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.050
They know it, you do not know that.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:16.290
So the situation becomes much worse here,
that the faith in Sahaja Yoga goes.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.290
Now this is not blind faith.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.400
This is the faith.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.450
One is blind faith and another is the faith,
means that you have now seen it and now you

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.440
have faith in it.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.030
It’s not like people, many I have seen many
people saying, “I believe” and ” I believe”

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.300
and “I believe”, out of what?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.040
Is a thing that you have felt, experienced,
you have had it and then you believe it.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.340
Of course you are not obliging anybody by
having faith, that’s one thing.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:52.840
It’s the grace of God that has really been
kind, extremely gracious, to grant this to

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.430
you.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:04.850
By that you do not oblige God or anybody,
nor Me.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.600
But despite that, it’s time.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:18.880
What grace, what grace, what beauty, what
love.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.949
It happens.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:29.620
But this faith does not settle down.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.240
Now the reasons for that are many, but is
a very dangerous thing.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.700
You can rationalise it.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.270
I’ve seen people who go away, then again
come back and they said, “Mother we are

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.310
sorry, I mean we were, we just doubted You,
went away this that, I started thinking about

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:53.450
it and I spoilt it and I lost it, and I said
‘oh it was just temporary,’ I went away.”

00:08:53.450 --> 00:09:01.839
Why not, once you get realisation settle down
with it for a while?

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.860
Why not see for yourself what it is?

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.540
All the gurus who take money and have made
a money making proposition out of God, which

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:19.490
is absolutely against God, anti-Christ and
anti all that is Divine, people stick onto

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.820
them much more, like leeches.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.550
One thing of course there is that they mesmerise,
there is no freedom, you cannot get out of

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.160
them, one thing, I agree.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.339
But the second is the money.

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:35.830
They get involved with them because they have
paid for it and they have to stick onto it,

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.690
because they have paid for it.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.290
And so many people have told Me Mother you
better take money from everybody who comes

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.480
in and they will stick on.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.040
I mean this is going too far.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.770
I have too much respect for humanity.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.740
I respect you too much, I do not think you
could be that low, I cannot think, and those

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.570
who are that low cannot get realisation also
perhaps.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.180
Maybe if you get it it’s not worth it you
see.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.950
We do not light lamps in paper bags, do we?

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.850
People have to be of some caliber to get realisation.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:22.880
But the faith, faith in Sahaja Yoga is the
only way you can rise and understand and move

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.820
and grow with it.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:34.680
The faith has to be so great that nothing
should disturb you.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.540
Look at these flowers sometimes, how delicate
they are.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.080
And it rains and sometimes it’s too sunny,
especially in London.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.839
You don’t know what sort of a climate it
is, it’s a funny climate absolutely!

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:58.510
But the flower to stand up to that, because
they have faith in the tree on which they

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.170
are born.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:07.570
That’s the strength-giving thing.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:14.960
And to know it, fully, so that you love it
more and more and imbibe within you more,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:30.399
is the only way you can really establish yourself
firmly into the strength of the Divine Power.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:43.590
The understanding of Sahaja Yoga is not mental
I told you yesterday, is not mental understanding.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.720
You cannot understand it through brains.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.550
If you try to understand it through brains
you get away from it.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.740
Because you cannot explain how it works out.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.860
It’s a miraculous thing, it’s a mystery.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.630
It’s a mystery.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:06.360
God is a mystery for man, will remain a mystery
to a point, but he (man) can become His power.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.220
He can become an instrument of His power.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:17.360
So you cannot comprehend the complete thing
through your brains.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.430
You cannot even comprehend a little bit through
your brains.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:30.690
Only thing is when you see it happening, you
see it working out, the effects of that experience

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:37.160
which are put on your brain, that gives you
faith.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.459
How do you have faith in a man?

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:44.089
Say there is a man who is very astute, straightforward.

00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:46.180
You give him ten pounds.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:52.010
He spends nine pounds three pence, returns
the rest to you.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.810
Then you give some more money.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.470
Again he does the same way; he returns all
the money that is due.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.720
By mistake he forgets, he again comes and
says, “This is it”.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.510
So you develop that faith in him.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.670
It has not come out of your intellectual understanding
of the man.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.460
A man may be very good, maybe a very great
cheat, could be a ‘very fine’ gentleman,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.020
very well dressed.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:22.500
Mostly I have seen sometimes when I see these
pictures where they show the bank robber especially

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.360
the gentleman is absolutely top class.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.160
He wears beautiful lined dresses you see,
he walks with an umbrella, straight forward

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.700
and he’s absolutely, you can see his face
and I mean it’s chiseled completely: beautiful

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:46.110
figure and extremely innocent face and all
that he puts it out very well.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.610
That’s why he can befool you.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.900
He can befool people very well and he can
get things out of them.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:08.870
But, in Sahaja Yoga, when you start feeling
it, seeing it, how it works, when you saw

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:14.160
this man, seeing the way he works you have
no faith in him anymore.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.370
You start seeing how Sahaja Yoga works and
then you have faith in it.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.220
And that is faith, that is not reasoning.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.580
Actually by reasoning you have achieved nothing
so far if you see it properly.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:38.770
For example, you see, all scientific laws,
were discovered, were seen, were felt.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:44.410
Even if something comes into my mind by thinking,
it could be just an imagination unless and

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.870
until I see [that] it works.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.930
Anything that does not work out doesn’t
become a law for us.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:56.380
So for Sahaja Yoga you have to see it.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.290
But not with the idea that, “Let me see
if it works or not”, that’s not the way,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.690
but just the seeing of it and understanding
it.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:16.589
If you sit down and reason out, Sahaja Yoga
– you will be lost in wilderness absolutely!

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:19.430
But how it works?

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.020
I’ll give you a very simple example.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.779
We have got the gentleman here, he wrote a
thesis.

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:31.510
I don’t know how many years he was working
with it.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.480
He could not get through it.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.570
He had not even made a bond out of it.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.880
It’s a very material style of understanding
but still.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:48.370
So he came to Me and he said, “Mother now
I leave it at your feet and I surrender it

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.370
to You.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.370
Do whatever you please.”

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.370
So I looked at it.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.370
He said, “Are you not going to read it?”

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.920
I said, “No need to read.”

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.630
I just put a little bandhan on it; put My
hand there, finished, that’s all.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.410
That’s all I did.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:07.870
By next year he was a Dr., He was.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.690
How it happens?

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.720
Today we received another letter from Portugal.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.630
There was one fellow, whom we had sent all
the articles, everything, but he had certain

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:25.620
problems with his sister and mother and all
that, so he didn’t want to do much of Sahaja

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.620
Yoga.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.060
And was another one, who wanted to do it.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.440
And he writes to Me saying that, “I received
everything.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440
I don’t know.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440
He does not know my address.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.899
How it has come to me I don’t know.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:37.029
Who has dropped it in my house?

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:41.970
I do not know how it has come to me; the address
was of that fellow.”

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.220
And that gentleman who has this address, does
not know his address.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.260
It’s that mysterious.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.780
There are angels.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:59.470
God has many hands, many eyes.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:06.149
He’s God Almighty, He’s very powerful.

00:17:06.149 --> 00:17:11.350
So after Sahaja yoga you cannot comprehend
Him.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:16.650
You can only see Him at work and you can see
His laws working out and you can see it works

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.650
out.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.260
A simple thing there’s a gentlemen sitting
here, now you put your hand on that.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:28.140
There was another case, very recently it happened,
one gentlemen came to Me and asked Me, “Why

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.669
everybody is asking about my father?

00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:30.669
What’s the matter?”

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:32.629
I said, “Really?

00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:34.429
They’re all asking about your father?”

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.429
I went further to tell him about his father
and he was surprised.

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:36.429
“How do you know?”

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:38.809
I said, “I just know.”

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:44.960
“But,” he said, “how did they all know
that there was something wrong with my father?”

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.370
I said, “There is a way of finding out.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:52.620
Everybody, even a little child knows it, something
wrong with your father.”

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.899
So when he put his hands toward that gentleman
the Right Heart was catching, everybody’s

00:17:57.899 --> 00:17:58.899
Right Heart.

00:17:58.899 --> 00:18:00.970
This is fathers.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.809
So he asked what’s wrong with your father?

00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:05.190
Now see the mystery.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.490
You see sahaja yogis also take it for granted.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:14.860
See the mystery, the alertness of the vibrations,
just think of it, how they work it out, that

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.970
you just extend the hands at somebody and
the vibrations tell you this gentleman is

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.480
catching the right heart.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.600
The Mother has told you that it means the
father’s problem, but that decoding I have

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.070
done, but what about these?

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:34.009
These vibrations they look so silent.

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:36.480
Do they think?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.639
How do they tell about anyone who may not
be here, present.

00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:41.710
You can tell.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.580
And if Sahaja Yogis just start telling about
that person that, “This has happened, that

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.200
has happened, and this person has got this,
and that person has got that.”

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.059
Sitting down here!

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:58.299
It’s a tremendous dynamic force which is
working it out.

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:05.259
But if you have no faith, then the same vibrations
know that you have no faith: They know you

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:12.529
out and out, absolutely out and out, They
know you too well.

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:31.519
It is They only who play around with you and
put you into problems, so that you realise

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:34.679
that you have been trying to cheat yourself.

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:40.749
You are cheating your own Spirit.

00:19:40.749 --> 00:19:47.130
You are not truthful to yours Self and it
would be like taking a dagger and putting

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.890
it through and being very happy, ‘Oh how
I have cheated myself.‘

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.539
It’s that foolish and stupid I tell you.

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:58.470
They know you too well.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:05.009
And they just take you round and put you into
a problem to realise that, “Do not cheat

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:09.769
anymore!”

00:20:09.769 --> 00:20:18.029
These dangers are there for all the people
who get realisation.

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:22.529
And the another realisation one should have,
when you see others around here, the kind

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:25.169
of people that come in.

00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:28.489
All kinds of people have come.

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:32.649
And when you start judging them also you should
know that if you become like that, you will

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:36.190
also have the same problem, even after realisation
possibly.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:41.030
For example some people start suddenly sulking
in Sahaja Yoga, say, after realisation, for

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.539
nothing at all.

00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:46.580
They should be, very aware of it immediately
give it up, and become cheerful.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:53.299
Is there a negative force pulling them down
to sulk?

00:20:53.299 --> 00:21:00.669
First sign of being a Sahaja Yogi is to have
a very cheerful disposition.

00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:05.370
Look at the flowers, look at them.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:11.610
Have you ever seen any flower which is not
dead [that’s] not cheerful?

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:21.820
If they are even at the fag end of their life,
they’ll try to cheer you.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:34.249
That is the first sign, and all such signs
should be expressed, not artificially, but

00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:37.220
really spontaneously, from within.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:43.760
And nothing should disturb you which is trivial,
useless.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.869
If you have faith in Sahaja Yoga, then you
must know you are here for a tremendous work

00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:51.991
of human emancipation.

00:21:51.991 --> 00:22:00.169
You have a very great responsibility.

00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:10.350
You represent that part of creation which
is the most important, the most vital.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:20.620
And if you fail it, it’s absolutely fatal
also.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:35.789
All this works out in such a manner, that
it builds up tremendous sense of security

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:40.059
within you, that you know you are standing
on the Truth.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:46.320
Hold it with both your hands; you’ll grow
on it.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.409
You’ll enjoy yourself.

00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:55.559
Life will be so much better, much more beautiful.

00:22:55.559 --> 00:23:04.049
And it is only through you the whole world
is going to be saved.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:15.749
So strengthen yourself, strengthen your arms
and strengthen your feet.

00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:23.220
The faith is the strength of Sahaja Yoga,
not the brainwaves that you have about it.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.789
Of course you need it sometimes to argue with
some intellectuals, you see, as I’ve told

00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:32.950
Gregoire to write the last two chapters for
all these “Rock of Gibraltars”.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:42.390
But, for you the greatest thing is the faith,
to enjoy it, because you have seen it, you

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.440
have known it, you have found it.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440
It is with you!

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.409
You are the master of it!

00:23:47.409 --> 00:23:53.850
It is at your service, and so beautiful, so
loving, so kind.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:58.789
Maybe today is the last day, I’m here.

00:23:58.789 --> 00:24:00.520
I’m going now.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:06.070
I may not be here for one and a half months
or so.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:12.720
I hope so, I’ll be back, by the 17th of
October or so.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:20.120
Whatever it is, even if I am away or anything,
Sahaja Yoga exists everywhere.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:26.970
Within you it is working, without you it is
working, everywhere it is working.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.409
So you see for yourself.

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:34.749
To see it you have to go and see people and
meet them and talk to them and find it out

00:24:34.749 --> 00:24:35.980
how it works.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.720
And develop that faith that gives you the
sense of security.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.929
There are so many ways of cleansing yourself,
which you know, you can find out.

00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:48.210
Meet each other.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:54.700
As many times as you can, call each other
for tea, meet each other, go around England.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.899
I was thinking when I’m out it would be
better that you go round to different centres,

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:03.690
meet people, get organised, get more people.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.990
Tell them, talk to them about it and do something.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:16.529
But they’ll judge you by your faith.

00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:20.549
And when you have found out the Reality, the
faith should be much greater than any of these

00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:29.629
fanatics have, any of these nonsensical people
have.

00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:32.460
But for faith, you must have the quality.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.350
Only people of quality can have that kind
of faith, not ordinary people.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.049
They’ll fall off.

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:48.830
All the flowers do not get transformed into
the fruit state.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:59.229
You are transformed into fruit state, but
all the fruits do not come up to their maturity,

00:25:59.229 --> 00:26:03.529
because they lack faith, the strength.

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:07.399
Gather up your strength.

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:13.269
It’s all behind you, it is within you, it’s
around you.

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:19.889
Everywhere there is light, within and without.

00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:22.100
Try to work it out properly.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.020
Do not condemn yourself or condemn others,
but know that you are something that you are

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.590
standing on the Truth.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:35.769
And you are in for the Kingdom of God, which
is promised to you, which you are in already

00:26:35.769 --> 00:26:37.090
walking in that.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:41.669
You are settled in there, just enjoy that
beauty.

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:48.619
May God bless you all.

00:26:48.619 --> 00:27:01.279
Is there any water for Me?

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.399
Water?

00:27:03.399 --> 00:27:09.450
Now I would like to know how many new people
are there, and, yes, just come forward those

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.309
who are new, and we’ll have a look at them.

00:27:12.309 --> 00:27:17.960
Those who have come for the first time please
come in and then I would suggest, that those

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:26.340
who come for the first time, must, “please
come”, must get to it, you see?

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.309
It’s a serious matter, you see, it’s not
just a shopping centre.

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:31.980
It’s not guru shopping.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:37.009
It is your own shopping I should say, it’s
your own being.

00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:42.090
So take to it seriously and work it out properly.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.779
Ask others.

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:48.080
Not that in any way they are higher or lower.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.870
Only thing, they got their realisation before
you came to me.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:57.350
So it’s alright, doesn’t matter, they’ll
tell you what is to be done.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:05.159
In Sahaja Yoga there is no subscription, there
is no compulsion, there is no membership as

00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:07.169
I told you.

00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:11.649
There is no way of aligning you with Sahaja
Yoga, no nothing.

00:28:11.649 --> 00:28:13.450
It’s your freedom, complete freedom.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:19.940
Your freedom is to be worshipped and to be
respected if you have to achieve the highest

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.909
of the highest.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:27.600
You have to be absolutely free because that
is the complete freedom you have to achieve.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.440
So nobody is going to force you to do anything
or compel you to do anything.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440
No!

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.799
You are left alone to yourself.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:51.519
No doubt there is a Kundalini within you which
rises and there is in every human a possibility

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:55.029
of achieving realisation.

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:57.759
Every human being should receive realisation.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:29:06.539
But it’s a real work; it’s living work,
and living work takes time.

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:17.429
If you people are of that caliber, you will
become great fruits of this creation.

00:29:17.429 --> 00:29:23.460
I will work as much as I can to keep you up
there, all my level best.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:29.279
I’ve worked very hard and I’ll always
work, and all of them are willing to help

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.880
you out.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.080
They have no problem.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.549
You too become like them, very soon.

00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:45.070
Now about Kundalini I must have spoken I don’t
know how many times and there are lots of

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.379
tapes with us.

00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:48.619
It’s all again intellectual feat, you see?

00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:53.600
Let’s see if the light is there, let us
see the light, then we’ll talk about it,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600
isn’t it?

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.299
I mean if I have to put the lights on I have
to just press the button.

00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:01.950
That’s what it is really, because it’s
all built in.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.489
Once it happens to you then you ask Me about
the engineering, it’s better, than to have

00:30:06.489 --> 00:30:09.840
the headache before and then the light.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:17.510
So let’s work it out that way, then later
on you can go through, you can find out for

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:26.349
yourself how it works, what is the system
that works it out, what is God’s plan for

00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:28.099
us, everything.

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:34.950
Gradually you see it for yourself that this
is the baptism that is promised to you, this

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:42.139
is the real re-birth that has been prophesised
before, this is the time that is promised

00:30:42.139 --> 00:30:47.970
that somebody will come and do this job for
you.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:53.820
And it is here, that you receive it.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.859
No religion is to be condemned because they
are different steps in your growth, but, you

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:08.649
should know what is real and what is unreal,
that’s very important.

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:15.639
Once you learn this science of God’s ways,
then you start talking about it.

00:31:15.639 --> 00:31:17.529
Before that you just see for yourself.

00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:25.190
Be just witnesses and achieve something out
of it, and make the best.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.269
May God bless you all
Now let’s have the feet like that straight,

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:31.769
just like that.

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:35.119
Just like that, yes.

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:37.279
And put your hands towards Me.

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:40.809
For anything small just do not get disturbed.

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:41.809
Keep your eyes shut.

00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:44.950
If you can put your hands on the lap it’s
alright, because you’ll be comfortable.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.120
Be comfortable!

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.969
If you have any discomfort in the stomach
or anything tightness you can loosen it, and

00:31:50.969 --> 00:31:52.029
it’s for your comfort only.

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:53.359
I want you to be comfortable.

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:56.179
That one thing is that you should be comfortable
bodily.

00:31:56.179 --> 00:32:00.649
Though the Kundalini’s such a sweet thing,
She’s your Mother, and She rises without

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:04.570
giving any trouble.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.960
Now close your eyes.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.049
Just close your eyes.

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:13.399
Everyone.

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:25.539
Aank ke band kar lijiye (Hindi: close your
eyes)

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:35.370
Now there are some centres within us, they
might get a little obstructed, supposing you

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.240
feel guilty for nothing at all, I mean there’s
nothing to feel guilty you see?

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.710
You are facing somebody who is love, so how
can you feel guilty before such a person who

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.859
is just love?

00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:49.429
So have no guilt of any kind.

00:32:49.429 --> 00:32:50.860
Then you have to forgive.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:57.190
You have to forgive all the people.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:02.119
Not to bear any bitterness just now, just
forgive, because by bearing that bitterness

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:07.849
you really embitter yourself, you do not torture
the other person.

00:33:07.849 --> 00:33:12.100
And lastly you have to ask for forgiveness,
if you have done any mistake by ignorance

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.440
or anything.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.419
You just ask for simple forgiveness.

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:31.259
All the obstructions can be overcome by the
rising Kundalini, She does that.

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:33.080
Just relax.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.179
It will happen by itself, you are not to do
anything.

00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:41.889
Keep your attention absolutely loose, if there
are thoughts, let them come, don’t worry,

00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:43.210
they will stop themselves.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.230
You don’t have to stop them.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.940
Do not put in any effort, just leave it alone.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.210
It will work out.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.849
It will just rise and work it out.

00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:56.399
You just leave it alone.

00:33:56.399 --> 00:34:11.500
Suddenly the thoughts stop.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:30.080
But you are aware, you are not sleeping, you
are not in a trance or anything you are absolutely

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.200
aware, but you reach a point where there are
no thoughts.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.190
But do not try to do that.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:41.760
Do not try to do that.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.906
And when the Kundalini pierces the fontanelle
bone area, the talu, you start getting cool

00:34:43.906 --> 00:34:44.906
breeze in the hands.

00:34:44.906 --> 00:34:45.906
In both the hands you start getting cool breeze
and also from your head, you start getting

00:34:45.906 --> 00:34:46.906
cool breeze.

00:34:46.906 --> 00:34:47.906
First a hot breeze I think and then the cool
breeze, for many people it happens like that,

00:34:47.906 --> 00:34:48.906
doesn’t matter.

00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:49.906
Good you see, you can feel it on his head,
here.

00:34:49.906 --> 00:34:50.906
You have a breathing trouble have you?

00:34:50.906 --> 00:34:51.906
Do you have a breathing problem normally?

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:52.906
Do you have any breathing problem?

00:34:52.906 --> 00:34:53.906
Hmm?

00:34:53.906 --> 00:34:54.906
No just don’t breathe, just leave it alone.

00:34:54.906 --> 00:34:55.906
Just..

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:56.906
Don’t you think it is too much breathing
or is it automatically it happens?

00:34:56.906 --> 00:34:57.906
Happening automatically.

00:34:57.906 --> 00:34:58.906
This ever happens before?

00:34:58.906 --> 00:34:59.906
Seeker: No.

00:34:59.906 --> 00:35:00.906
Shri Mataji: It never happened before you
say?

00:35:00.906 --> 00:35:01.906
Hmm?

00:35:01.906 --> 00:35:02.906
You have been to some guru or someone?

00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:03.906
You’ll be all right.

00:35:03.906 --> 00:35:04.906
It will work out.

00:35:04.906 --> 00:35:05.906
You’re all right.

00:35:05.906 --> 00:35:06.906
You’ll be all right.

00:35:06.906 --> 00:35:07.906
Is he, is he all right?

00:35:07.906 --> 00:35:08.906
Are you all right?

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:09.906
How are you feeling?

00:35:09.906 --> 00:35:10.906
Seeker: I’m feeling hot on the right.

00:35:10.906 --> 00:35:11.906
Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:35:11.906 --> 00:35:12.906
Can you sit there?

00:35:12.906 --> 00:35:13.906
Would be better nearby.

00:35:13.906 --> 00:35:14.906
Let’s look at her.

00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:15.906
Just look after her.

00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:16.906
Just sit down.

00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:17.906
You’re all right.

00:35:17.906 --> 00:35:18.906
Now what about her?

00:35:18.906 --> 00:35:19.906
Can you see?

00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:20.906
After [?] your vibrations will be all right.

00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:21.906
Cooly can you see the vibrations of this gentleman.

00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:22.906
What about these Indians up front can you
see there vibrations?

00:35:22.906 --> 00:35:23.906
This gentleman, this gentleman, there are
two ladies there.

00:35:23.906 --> 00:35:24.906
Are you all right now better?

00:35:24.906 --> 00:35:25.906
Good.

00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:26.906
Just can you come up and tie up the Kundalini?

00:35:26.906 --> 00:35:27.906
Come and help, tie her up.

00:35:27.906 --> 00:35:28.906
No, just proceed.

00:35:28.906 --> 00:35:29.906

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:30.906
Keep your eyes open.

You have done some breathing for exercises?

00:35:31.906 --> 00:35:32.906
No?

00:35:32.906 --> 00:35:33.906
You have not been to any guru or spiritualist
or anyone?

00:35:33.906 --> 00:35:34.906
You never get this trouble normally?

00:35:34.906 --> 00:35:35.906
No?

00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:36.906

You have some sense of insecurity, what is

00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:49.906
You are not well?

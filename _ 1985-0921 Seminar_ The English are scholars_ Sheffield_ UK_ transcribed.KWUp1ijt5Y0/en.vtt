00:03:36.930 --> 00:04:21.190
As 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:06:09.400
I said yesterday, this is the field, field
where the light has to come.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.580
With so many lights, the field has to be enlightened.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:29.620
And this field which is enlightened is enriched
by nature, too.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:38.050
And when you were singing I felt the clouds
were catching the notes, weaving them within

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.729
themselves and when it would rain, the rain
will sing the song again.

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:55.440
As if the valleys were resounding so beautifully
and the echo was very gentle and filling the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.229
whole atmosphere.

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:04.510
Perhaps you are not aware of the subtle, of
the Divine, how much It is anxious to work

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.310
it out.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:22.570
But our trumpets 
and our flutes and our drums have to be all

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.180
right.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:41.090
There has to be coordination, complete synchronizing,
then the melody is played in a beautiful way.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:49.990
Clouds only carry the purest water, the purest
hymns.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:59.710
So when we are spreading the message, we have
to understand that it has to come from a pure

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.169
source, purity is very important.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:10.480
I’ve already talked about chastity part
which is the Mooladhara, which is so important

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.490
today; you can see it clearly how important
it is.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:24.509
But that’s not the end of it; that’s just
the beginning, just the beginning.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:39.099
But what we have to see is something very
innate built within us.

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:48.400
And today as we are sitting in the heart of
hearts that is Sheffield where the steel is

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:58.890
made, in the heart the steel, sometimes you
need a part of steel also in the heart.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:06.069
We have to see where are we lacking, what’s
our basic problem.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:11.699
We should face it.

00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:24.030
So as English we are, we have to think how
our brains work, are used to work, how traditionally

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.790
we have been brought to problems.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:34.540
When we see around how we have accepted some
things which were very absurd and nonsensical,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:43.900
say in America or in France and other places,
as if we have no personality of our own.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:50.600
What did we give to others?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.220
What is the impression people carry about
the British?

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:11.980
Hippies, or what do you call these days modern
- the punks.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:18.180
What is it that we have to give?

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:25.730
Is a honorable image, is a honorable image
of the British, of the English.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:34.550
We have to be honored, we have to be honorable
people, and we must keep our honor.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:49.050
And honor cannot come or cannot be expressed
if we are people who are cunning.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:59.579
That’s very superficial, anybody can find
out if we have that cunning within us.

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:07.980
Now it has been a character, can be very cunning
- that’s what I discussed this morning.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.070
Be careful on that, be careful.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:21.350
That’s a trick of the ego, don’t fall
a prey to that.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.460
And that then works out in our languages also.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:31.490
Now English language is a specially honored
language now because it is the language of

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.870
the Sahaja Yoga as well.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:41.880
Of course we use Hindi, Marathi and then English.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:50.670
But English is the language in which My speeches
are, so it should be honored.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:57.060
We must have a sense of honor that comes by
respecting.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.320
When you respect yourself, you respect others.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.260
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot
respect others.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:13.620
And that’s what I’ve discovered that when
people took to anti-culture and all sorts

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:20.529
of things the first thing they did was not
to respect anything whatsoever.

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:28.089
And yesterday only I discovered that the language
which is spoilt has come through this: is

00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:35.000
fashionable to speak with a funny accent,
and I was copying that the Americans speak

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.449
like duck – quack, quack, quack.

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:51.130
But the English speak like a crow - caw, caw,
caw - and we have real English language problem.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.470
Just now Nick’s wife told Me that she can’t
understand what English speak.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.560
I said, “Same here, I don’t understand
either.”

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.540
It’s a language problem.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:08.910
One gentleman who came from India, very well
educated gentleman, did his MA in English,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.899
he came back and he said, “I had a language
problem there.”

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.220
I said, “Why?”

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:22.820
He said, “They speak all kinds, they divert
it every way and educated people talk like

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.820
that.”

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:30.500
And was surprised that it has also come from
anti-culture, is a fashion to speak like that.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.320
And I can’t follow.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:41.150
That means it is anti-God.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.740
So you must respect your language.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:50.550
You might be acquiring it from hippie stage,
or you might be getting it, say, even from

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:54.829
Cambridge or from Oxford or from public schools.

00:13:54.829 --> 00:14:03.870
Whatever it is, whatever may be the source,
either it is aggression on the language or

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.839
no respect to the language.

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:20.110
So in language, in speaking the language,
try to speak straightforward English language.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.220
Because we are international people.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.510
We are not English anymore.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.100
We are grown to be global people now.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:37.639
We have a global personality, and as global
people we have to speak a language which everybody

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:39.140
can understand.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.980
We cannot speak cockneyed language.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.329
I mean in India also we have lots of cockneyed.

00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:52.579
But Sahaja Yogis don’t speak that language.

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:59.509
You won’t understand that cockneyed language
that we speak even if you are an expert on

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:02.449
any Indian language.

00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:14.660
So first of all, you must show respect of
your own language, more than anything else.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.790
If you cannot respect your country, your language,
your literature, your sublime things that

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:28.019
are here, your buildings, how can you respect
anything else?

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:34.259
This is your soil, which is not to be aggressed
this way.

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:40.769
That doesn’t mean we become nationalist,
I did not mean that, but to grow out as a

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:47.120
tree you have to know your soil and you have
to respect and be honorable.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.080
Where is that English honor which I used to
hear about?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.149
Is lost in the thin air somewhere?

00:15:55.149 --> 00:16:04.279
An honorable person will not keep back taxes,
will not ill-treat his wife, will not ill-treat

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:12.300
her husband, will not talk rudely to them,
would be respectable, will respect the children.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:18.810
First thing is that he respects everybody’s
freedom.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:26.310
If he’s mean, then he’s not honorable.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.810
If he’s not generous, then he is not honorable.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:38.839
If he disobeys the law, he’s not honorable
either.

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:40.149
Why should we disobey the law?

00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.350
I just don’t understand.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.770
Actually English laws are meant for angels
I tell you, horrible.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.710
But in that only the devils take advantage.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:56.970
Doesn’t matter, laws are very good no doubt.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.100
But why should we break the laws unnecessarily?

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:04.240
If it is necessary, all right.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.500
But for every small thing if you start breaking
the laws, then we start breaking the laws

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.419
of the Divine also.

00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:15.390
So we have to learn all these things.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:25.760
Let us be in an honorable way, accept things
which are good but not fashionable.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.940
Fashionable things - now it is fashionable
to be like this, it is fashionable to be like

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.940
that.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:42.330
Now what I feel that fashion only is accepted
by people who have no personality at all.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:50.090
Tomorrow somebody starts saying that “You
put a empty tin of jam on your head.”

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:57.350
Supposing, I mean, if they say so, “You’ll
look taller,” or something like that.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.790
I mean maybe a little, or let the jam falls
on your face.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.169
Any clownish nonsense we accept so easily.

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:16.000
It’s all clownish, and clowns are the only
ones who copy like this because they have

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.080
to amuse people by clowning.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:25.260
But are we to become clowns now?

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:33.230
So by this kind of diffidence in our character
that we try to copy others without understanding

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.270
what they are doing, we are becoming clowns.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:43.639
I mean you can see many like that.

00:18:43.639 --> 00:18:49.960
So the clownishness is now one of the characters
of the British.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:57.100
They really sometimes appear to Me like clowns.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:06.620
Because they try to copy others and whenever
you try to copy others, you are not the others.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.669
Like say we try to copy, say for example,
Americans - very difficult.

00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:18.740
They are so childish and stupid, we can’t
do that good, you see.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:28.850
I’ve seen a film of some Americans - I hope
there are no Americans sitting here - where

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:36.660
they had about hundred people, actors and
actresses above seventy or eighty years of

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:43.010
age all shaking, you see, and they all wearing
funny dresses, you see, half way missing,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:50.860
or this way missing, all sorts of things missing,
you see, less clothes than normal.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:58.680
And they were doing funny dances, you see,
all walking with sticks and doing shake.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.350
Or they were shaking already.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:13.260
Now for English they love to use their umbrellas
I think.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:22.010
So they look clownish because you don’t
carry sticks, you carry umbrellas.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.760
So trying to do something that is American
would be stupid.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.950
There’s no need to copy them.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.970
Even outside, then why inside?

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:44.010
When you are a global personality, as in the
nature you can see a mango tree looks like

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.550
a mango tree.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:52.120
It doesn’t try to become like an apple tree,
does it?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.480
And then that mango, when it is ripe, goes
to the whole world.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.000
Whatever is the best mango you can find it
in Russia, you can find it in America, you

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.090
can find it all over.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.279
That’s how it becomes a global personality.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:10.290
But mango remains a mango; it is not an apple.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:17.290
Who is going to import apples from India,
in England?

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.169
That would be stupid.

00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:28.129
So the personality that you are already, you
are a British personality, or English personality

00:21:28.129 --> 00:21:36.470
or an Irish personality, or whatever personality
you are, should be such is presentable to

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:40.230
others to be cherished, to be enjoyed.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.940
How is it possible?

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:50.980
You have to be excellent, first class, top
personality.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.240
So this clownishness must be given up.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.740
And it has come so much in England that I
feel the heart is absolutely oppressed by

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.680
this stupid things.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.660
But there are certain nonsensical things which
have come within us which we should give up.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:16.560
As I said, first of all the cunningness, then
in our language there should be straightforward

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.440
expression, no sarcasm.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:27.820
There’s no intelligence in sarcasm.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:40.090
Saying something nice to others is a great
art.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:50.490
Have we developed that art of saying something
nice to others?

00:22:50.490 --> 00:23:00.320
This art is to be developed by Sahaja Yogis,
how to say something sweet and nice to others.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:16.919
If you can develop the gentle method of saying
nice things, then later on you will see you

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:23.139
will be able to do nice things for others
- little, little things here and there.

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:28.590
Like the little girl bringing beautiful pink
flowers one after another.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:40.659
You are nice to Me no doubt, but to each other
and to others who come to us?

00:23:40.659 --> 00:23:52.720
So how to say nice things, what to say, when
to say, this we must learn.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.230
And so we can establish communication.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:04.570
Self-consciousness, self-opinionatedness can
never give you that.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.480
“I don’t care, all right let him be angry,
so what do I care?”

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.700
Very common expression.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.679
But if you say to the person, “Why are you
angry?

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:21.260
I do care when you are angry.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.850
What’s the problem?

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.610
Can I not help you there?”

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.679
Finished.

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:33.650
He’ll say, “What sort of a angel I’m
meeting here?”

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.800
Like yesterday the fellow was very aggressive
and he asked Me about heaven and hell and

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800
all that.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.200
I was least bothered.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.849
He was neutralized.

00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:50.490
You must learn, this is an art which one has
to learn.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:55.619
Don’t be proud of your harsh tongues and
your hot tempers.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:56.619
Don’t be proud.

00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:58.470
“I’m angry with him.”

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.730
So what, is it a very good thing to be angry
with others?

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:08.000
“I got very angry,” you see, with very
great pride they will tell Me.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.240
“I got very angry for that.”

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.280
‘Why?

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.210
As Christ has said, only one anger is allowed:
if somebody says something against your Mother

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.100
that He’s not going to tolerate.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.460
But that, too, controlled.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.200
Yesterday many were angry but it was all right.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.720
I know how to manage things.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:46.879
So we have to learn also to tell ourselves,
“Let us not be so self-opinionated.”

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:50.480
We have to learn a lot.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:58.300
There is so much to be seen, so much to be
learnt, so much to be understood, outside

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.390
also.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:09.500
Like British are absolutely insular by temperament.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.000
Another matching with them are Japanese, equal
type.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.280
Japanese also don’t talk much but don’t
absorb anything whatsoever.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.100
You can imagine three hundred years English
were in India, they learnt nothing.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.890
Can you imagine?

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.290
Can you believe it?

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:38.869
Three hundred years, generations, seven-eight
generations they were in India.

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:44.410
While here, when the Indians come, they too
have no personality.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.899
They pick up your dresses, they pick up your
language, they pick up everything.

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:54.110
They talk with the same slang and hundred
times they’ll say dirty words in it and

00:26:54.110 --> 00:27:00.510
they’ll say, “Yes man, no man, what man”
- to a woman also, unisex.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:06.850
They have too much absorbage.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:14.010
They absorb everything while you don’t absorb
anything.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.220
So these are two extreme cases.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:32.350
So as it is said in Sanskrit that what is
the difference between the swan and hamsa

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.350
and the crow?

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:40.840
No, no sorry, crow is black so I’m sorry
- hamsa and what do you call that?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.039
Crane, crane.

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:49.130
What is the difference between a crane - yes
it is crane, isn’t it Gavin, in the water?

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.130
Crane.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:59.040
So what is the difference between the crane
and the swan?

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:08.589
So when they have to discriminate between
water and milk, then you can find out who

00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:13.149
is the crane and who is the swan.

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:16.300
Nirak shira viveket.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.510
Vivek is proper decision.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:28.200
So if you put water mixed with milk before
a swan, the swan will just suck in the milk

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.860
and the crane will suck the whole.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.100
He wouldn’t know.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.460
So that is what is, again we come to the same
point, is discretion that we have to develop.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.140
[Shri Mataji interrupts Her talk to point
out people] There are people they are looking

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.140
out for us.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.480
They are lost there.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.320
They are Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.580
I think they saw us here.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.080
They saw Me.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:04.410
So it is the discretion that we have to pick
up all that is good, all that is nice, from

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.780
everywhere, which is such a lot, such a lot.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:14.540
Like I would say, what’s nice about British?

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:21.919
Let’s see.

00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:46.610
Can you tell Me, who is going to tell Me that?

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:54.570
Yogi: They have a great deal of tolerance.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.120
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120
Tolerance.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.680
No, no, not at all.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.040
It has to be a common quality, whether you
are a Sahaja Yogi or not.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.470
Tolerance is the least, that’s something
lacking.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:19.020
Yogi: They’re good leaders, Mother.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.740
Shri Mataji: You think so?

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.690
Yogi: Fair play.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:39.180
Shri Mataji: Fair play I don’t know now
- that might have been.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.020
They were not very fair with Indians, were
they?

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.800
They were not very fair with Chinese, never.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.370
Still go further.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:55.120
Yogi: Talking about the weather.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.409
Shri Mataji: That would be bad weather.

00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:07.030
Yes, I mean superficiality, but that’s not
a good thing.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:12.250
Yogi: Shri Mataji, they have very sharp minds.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.860
Shri Mataji: Sharp what?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.170
Sharp minds.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.470
Yogi: Intelligence.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.350
Shri Mataji: You’re near, but not there.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.750
Yogi: Inventions, Mother.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:30.929
Shri Mataji: Not so much, Americans are better.

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:33.560
Yogi: Subtle.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.510
Shri Mataji: Subtle.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:44.659
I wouldn’t say that.

00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:46.640
Not that, not so much.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.360
Yogi: They want to help others.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.720
Shri Mataji: Seldom.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.960
Yogi: Manipulative

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.450
Shri Mataji: That’s bad.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.810
Yogi: Loyal, Mother.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.170
Shri Mataji: Loyal?

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:14.659
They create disloyalties, problems.

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:16.510
They make people fight.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:28.500
Yogi: Once they find something good Mother
they will stick onto it.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.790
Shri Mataji: I wish they could.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.070
I wish they could, but the way they disappeared,
every time we had programs after that what

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.340
I find everything disappeared.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.050
Sticking on quality is missing.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.320
Now is all right everybody has said?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.610
I wish you had all those qualities, you could,
why not?

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:53.930
So all the qualities that are desired have
been expressed, but what really are?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.590
Should I tell you?

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.590
Scholarship.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:59.590
Scholarship.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.260
Sahaja Yoga?

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.090
Read everything.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:10.920
Sahaja Yoga means Kundalini, means this, that,
go to the library, find out everything.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.640
Just know it.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640
Scholarship.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.279
That’s their quality.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:24.370
And this has to spread all over.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:28.960
You agree there?

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:39.810
The scholarship in Sahaja Yoga has to spread
all over the world.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:44.580
The women specially want to compete with men
here.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.480
Very difficult, English women, not easy.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.409
Not all, but some.

00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:53.790
They should become scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:34:04.660
I’m surprised people like Derek or people
like Hesta could not see the point.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:11.720
Scholarship is the thing and that’s why
they’re honored everywhere.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.260
They are scholars.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.740
And see now, heart becoming a scholar.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:31.669
That’s the integration of the brain and
the heart.

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:35.659
We have so many scholars of Sahaja Yoga in
England.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:39.260
We might get one there and one here and there.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.510
Like we can say in Switzerland we’ve got
Gregoire and Arneau.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:53.510
Scholarship - how many are there?

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:58.520
And very deep scholarship.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:09.530
And that is what you have to develop more,
specially the ladies have to learn a lot,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.119
is knowledge.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:24.680
To understand all the intricacies, all the
delicacies, and to work it out in that scholarly

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:34.920
way, is the way you will really do greatest
service to Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:43.290
And is such a honorable thing to be a scholar
and once you are a scholar, this knowledge

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:48.960
goes into your head goes to your heart also.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.770
Scholarship in every subject.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.720
Scholars are different from inventive people.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:02.130
They may know very little and can invent something,
that’s a different thing.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:08.650
But that doesn’t mean you go and read Vivekananda
and all that, doesn’t mean that.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:19.760
But you go in every library, every place and
discover the Truth.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:32.440
Blake - scholar, so many scholars in this
country, most of them were Realized Souls.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:38.440
In England we have the maximum number, in
the West I’m saying, maximum number of scholars,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:48.420
who were Realized Souls, in such a small,
little country like that.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:55.400
In India of course we had saints who were
scholars, saints who were not scholars.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:05.079
So the scholarship part is your responsibility,
and like a scholar you have to be above many

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.079
things.

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:09.970
A scholar doesn’t stoop down to nonsense.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.960
He doesn’t take to superficial thing.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.670
It’s below his dignity to behave in childish
manner or to take to sex and all this nonsensical

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.960
ideas.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.690
But the basic quality you have got which is
something so great I feel, because heart becoming

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.330
a scholar is something very great.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:43.370
It’s a balance, it’s a real balance, and
that’s the steel, that is the steel of England,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.090
the scholarship.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:53.240
That’s how a New Jerusalem has to be built
in, not the old one where they were only faithfuls

00:37:53.240 --> 00:38:02.279
just going down singing songs and hymns, nothing
- but scholarship, the complete knowledge.

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:06.750
They know everything about Kundalini, they
know all about chakras, they know all details

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:15.190
about it and, if you may please, your Mother
has spoken in England the maximum number of

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:24.650
lectures, because there are scholars.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:33.259
So preserve that, develop that, then only
you will have all other qualities which you

00:38:33.259 --> 00:38:35.960
have described just now.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.720
But remember that you are yogis, but scholars
in your subject.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.910
Take any subject that you are dealing with
- even ordinary thing, we can say if you are

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:51.059
a carpenter you must know everything about
wood.

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:56.250
What is this wood, from where it comes, what
is it, what can be used for, what is the density

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:07.410
of this wood, what is the chemical composition,
everything you must know about it.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:18.609
And this is what you have to give to other
people of the world.

00:39:18.609 --> 00:39:25.500
Once you start doing all this, you will give
up all the malpractices which British have

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.500
taken to.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.670
First of all they are the worst of all, is
to create problems between two persons - they

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.349
are good at it.

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:42.849
Like, now you see now in South Africa what
they did, create problem between one shade

00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:46.040
of black with another shade of black.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.799
Very clever.

00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:53.789
Now when this scholarship was perverted they
were the ones, you know they were the ones

00:39:53.789 --> 00:39:57.359
who started this idea that the blacks are
primitive.

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:00.670
They are the ones who introduced this idea.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.170
The same scholarship used for bad purposes.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:12.380
Who gave these ideas were about four or five
writers who said they were primitive.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:23.990
Very nice - brand them as primitive, because
scholars after all can brand anything as anything.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.750
So it is necessary for us to bring goodness.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:40.230
To bring benevolence in this world we must
write benevolent things, write something idealistic,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:53.430
something higher, something hopeful, something
which gives them a new dimension of understanding.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.589
All the Sahaja Yogis must start writing.

00:40:57.589 --> 00:41:01.359
Ramdas Swami has said that, “Every day you
must write something.”

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:15.779
Write diaries, write novels, write articles,
do what you like - poems, poetry.

00:41:15.779 --> 00:41:25.910
All kinds of things you can do if you just
know that you have to be yogi scholars, but

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:29.660
not intellectuals.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:37.130
Intellectuals have the knowledge of others,
but scholars built up their knowledge on the

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.619
true knowledge of others.

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:46.880
That’s the difference between a scholar
and an intellectual.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.590
Intellectual has nothing of his own, he’s
a confused person and he doesn’t want to

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:59.270
say, because he’s so frightened that if
he says anything that “This is what I think,”

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:11.079
then people might say that he is a man of
domination or something like that.

00:42:11.079 --> 00:42:18.460
You need not be a graduate, you need not be
anything, but that quality is built within

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:24.640
you, which is a very big thing and is very
much connected.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:37.670
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know that the heart
is surrounded by seven main auras and these

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:42.940
come from the brain, which is the seat.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:51.730
Now in the center, at the Brahmarandra we
have got the Heart Chakra, all right?

00:42:51.730 --> 00:43:02.369
The heart is here and around it are all these
auras, if you see in the brain.

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:10.200
In the same way they are surrounding the heart.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:21.690
So if you know about them, it will circulate,
the knowledge will circulate, but circulate

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:33.079
with love, without any aggressiveness, without
any showing off, without any cunning, without

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:46.910
any sarcasm, in a full, straightforward, loving
manner.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:54.369
But for that we have to remember that we have
developed lots of antidotes in England.

00:43:54.369 --> 00:44:05.460
Like the words I have seen people use very
common is: “That may be too much; it may

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.410
be too much.”

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.050
They’re frightened.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:16.660
“One shouldn’t say too much.”

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.660
You should!

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:24.910
When you say too much at least little bit
will go into their heads.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:32.759
So you have to say too much, say what you
want.

00:44:32.759 --> 00:44:43.080
There should be exuberance, exuberance of
your ideas so that something goes into their

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.309
heads, they know that you are sincere, you’re
saying it sincerely, you cannot contain within

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:51.730
yourself, emphatically you have to say things.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.920
That’s what everybody did.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:03.580
All those who were great incarnations said
it with such concern, with such force.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.539
In the same way you have to say, without any
fear.

00:45:09.539 --> 00:45:13.380
“Oh that may be too much, Mother it was
too much for him.”

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.650
Let him be blasted.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.790
Doesn’t matter.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:26.869
Say everything that you have to say absolutely
with full heart.

00:45:26.869 --> 00:45:38.710
But when people come to Sahaja Yoga, when
they come for, say, a workshop or something,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:49.529
we try to be the same party people, like in
the party you see, “What will you have?”

00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:57.690
Then they will say, “All right, let me think
what did I have yesterday, so I’ll have

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:58.859
today this thing.”

00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:03.170
It’s like a shopping going on.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:10.619
No, you have to say, “We have this and please
have it now, otherwise you won’t have it.”

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:22.019
This is the time, let them say what they like.

00:46:22.019 --> 00:46:24.299
Is important.

00:46:24.299 --> 00:46:34.029
I see sometimes your SDP conferences and all
this, baap re baap [note: this is an expression

00:46:34.029 --> 00:46:36.670
in Hindi to express disappointment], the way
they speak, they just blast you, I mean hammer

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:37.670
in your head.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:42.789
And why should we not when this is the truth?

00:46:42.789 --> 00:46:48.480
Why should we not tell them, and talk to them
in that manner?

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:57.019
We think by being gentle - all right gentleness
is different, but I mean to say by saying

00:46:57.019 --> 00:47:02.180
less than I see, understatement is typical
English statement.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.579
“That might be too much.”

00:47:04.579 --> 00:47:12.530
In Sahaja Yoga it is such a lot that how much
are you going to pour out?

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.010
Can never be too much, so be careful on that.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:19.819
When you have to say it, say it in a very
blasty way, doesn’t matter.

00:47:19.819 --> 00:47:20.819
What are they going to do?

00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:24.710
They can’t crucify Me this time, can they?

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.549
They dare not.

00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:31.700
Otherwise perfectly all right, nothing can
touch Me, and even crucifixion cannot touch

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.880
Me, you know that.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.730
So you better say what you have found out
in a big way and tell them in a big way.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:46.980
Of course loving and gentle manner, but tell
them, the concern should be there.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.349
All right?

00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:57.390
Now this is what it is, one has to understand,
that there is nothing “Say little bit.”

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:02.640
Then they think he is a shaky man.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.910
But when they sing horrible songs on the mike,
eating the mike I say, calling, “eating

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:08.910
the mike music.”

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:19.380
They go on, you see, aggressing on the mike
and people go mad with it, they like it.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:25.819
I don’t say you aggress, but don’t say
anything less, understatement is not needed.

00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:33.630
There should be not be any balancing in that.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:44.190
Those people who will be appeased by that
will not be good Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.759
They cannot come in the Kingdom of God.

00:48:46.759 --> 00:48:58.480
We don’t have to be begging of them but
we have to honor them, we have to respect

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.920
them, we have to be kind to them.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.410
But we have to give them what we have.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:09.319
Like in the family you go, you get everything
from the fridge and give it to them, they’ll

00:49:09.319 --> 00:49:10.740
be very happy - take it whatever you like.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.480
What a spread.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:26.009
But if you put one little fish and two eggs
for ten people with one chili to say that

00:49:26.009 --> 00:49:36.039
it is Sahaja Yoga, maybe a lemon, they will
think, “What’s this going on here?

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.039
Wishy-washy stuff.”

00:49:37.039 --> 00:49:45.069
Now that’s one thing.

00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:54.369
Secondly there are words that people use very
commonly: “That is very fussy.”

00:49:54.369 --> 00:49:57.059
That shows your fears.

00:49:57.059 --> 00:50:06.941
In Sahaja Yoga nothing is fussy, nothing is
fussy.

00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:07.941
Always it is so.

00:50:07.941 --> 00:50:12.410
“It is very fussy, it is this is fussy that
is fussy.”

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:20.630
It is coming to such an extent that people
now like beggarish existence; they want to

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:30.650
dress up like beggars, rustic, nonsensical
things, worn-out clothes, worn-out faces.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.619
I was telling Gavin the other day, “Why
do you all like sand color?

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:34.619
There’s no sand here.

00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:37.369
Is something Arabic in you that you like all
sand everywhere?”

00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:52.770
As it is the hair are blonde, face is sand-like,
clothes are sand.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:51:00.680
Mountains of sand, walking around.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.079
Why not be colorful?

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:07.420
Why not wear colors?

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.460
Sahaja Yogis must wear colors.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.839
Of course you should not be dandies.

00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:19.010
I must tell you that, otherwise you will be
dandies, you see, like wearing shocking pinks

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.710
by men, and sort of thing.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:22.869
I don’t mean that.

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:28.809
But you shouldn’t just go about with sand
color and a grey color.

00:51:28.809 --> 00:51:35.020
If you start wearing something nice, they
will also produce.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.480
I wanted to buy a sweater for Gavin in green
color.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.299
I couldn’t get one light green.

00:51:40.299 --> 00:51:41.809
I said, “Let’s have one.”

00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:43.020
I said, “You look.”

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.690
No, couldn’t get one for him.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.430
They don’t make it - only sand.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:52.210
And I got it.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.150
Or else grey.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:52:01.910
Already the sky is grey, faces are grey, dresses
are grey, they wear grey suits, the horses

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.700
are grey, the world is around grey – all
horrible.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.960
And then wear a grey dress to match with it.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:19.940
So, there’s nothing like fussy in Sahaja
Yoga but you should not be childish, frivolous,

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940
stupid.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.960
And you should not be also dandyish, showing
off.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:33.190
Like I have seen people painting their car
with gold and all that nonsense, or wearing

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:44.230
a bow tie and a dinner jacket and walking
on the streets of Oxford Street to match with

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:54.079
these horrible Hare Ramas there, to make a
contrast to them.

00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:58.569
That’s not necessary.

00:52:58.569 --> 00:53:07.460
On this also you could be scholars, you can
find out.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:15.980
About children, I’m very much worried now,
much more since I heard about this three-year-old

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.250
girl.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:24.670
And I have to say that your children are precious,
they’re wonderful people.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:30.800
In the beginning they have suffered because
of you, but they come out of it, and they

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.880
become so great.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.730
But you must learn one thing, is to be very
attentive to your children, don’t neglect

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:38.730
them.

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:44.210
Teach them habits by which they do not learn
things which will destroy them.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:50.770
Like every child picks up everything, puts
it in the mouth.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:55.890
We too here in England or anywhere in the
West, people just put their fingers in the

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:59.029
mouth like that they will go.

00:53:59.029 --> 00:54:01.720
Anything they’ll just - supposing they are
opening a can.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:09.170
Now the can spills out some jam, so they put
it in the fingers inside.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:10.170
No.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.730
That jam can, might be having some germs.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:17.790
So anything that is to be put in the mouth
you must wash.

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:25.200
That’s now has to be the law for Sahaja
Yogis, because so many germs, so many things,

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.560
and for children specially they must be told.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.010
If anything falls on the ground it’s a very
mundane thing but you must learn how we tell

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.099
our children.

00:54:33.099 --> 00:54:35.880
Anything falls on the ground, immediately
you’ll pick up and throw away somewhere

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880
and wash our hands.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.349
We’ll just say, “No, no, no, no, no, no,
not that.”

00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:47.369
Even from the mouth, if something falls out
you are not to pick up.

00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:53.309
Unless and until you really fanatically do
that, your children cannot be saved from all

00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:57.690
kinds of infections that are around.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:02.559
India is full of parasites and we have many
more, I mean we are the country where we breed

00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:05.619
and look after them and cherish them I think.

00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:15.829
All kinds of parasites we have had, politically
also many parasites on us, but all said and

00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:25.450
done, we know how to keep out of them, you
see, and that’s how we have to really condition

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.279
our children.

00:55:27.279 --> 00:55:31.400
Secondly, never to leave your child alone
anywhere.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.359
Learn a lesson.

00:55:35.359 --> 00:55:38.809
At any cost you should not leave the child
alone.

00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:44.559
You can leave it with somebody who can look
after the child, who can run a crèche, who

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:47.420
can do something of that kind.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:55.230
But pay attention to this point that there
should be no loneliness for a child.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:56:01.920
Child must be made to sleep in your room,
maybe another cot, maybe crib.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:08.220
When slightly grown up, still should be with
you, if there’s a grown-up another child

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:13.160
you can make, or some aunt or somebody sleeping
with.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.650
But don’t make children feel that they are
lonely.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:22.440
Psychologically it will affect, and also physically
there could be a problem.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.880
We never, never, never allow our children
to be alone, do you know that, in India?

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.210
I mean we are ourselves surprised how the
children just go out.

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:38.040
Now supposing some child, say about five-year-old
says, “I’m going to a candy shop.”

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.040
Nothing doing.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.819
Mother will say, “All right, when I go you
will buy it, candy.”

00:56:43.819 --> 00:56:50.890
I mean when My daughters were not married,
till then they never went out alone, can you

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.109
believe it?

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:53.109
Never.

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:56.499
Even to school if they were going, they were
in the car with the driver.

00:56:56.499 --> 00:57:00.080
Even if they were going to colleges they were
going in the car with the driver.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080
Never alone.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:07.809
And if they were going, say, by buses or anything,
later on when they went to higher education,

00:57:07.809 --> 00:57:14.859
they were going with friends.

00:57:14.859 --> 00:57:20.539
Safety of children has to be looked after
in this negative atmosphere everywhere.

00:57:20.539 --> 00:57:26.059
We are very good because we have this challenge
all the time, so we are very careful, and

00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:32.359
you people have to be now made more aware
towards your children.

00:57:32.359 --> 00:57:36.230
But don’t spoil them, you spoil your children
too much.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:40.529
I know they are very joy-giving because they
are Realized Souls.

00:57:40.529 --> 00:57:45.150
But tell them, “You are Realized Souls and
you cannot be dishonorable.”

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:46.369
But not at the time.

00:57:46.369 --> 00:57:50.880
I’ve seen that you correct your children
when they’ll misbehave, “Don’t do that!”

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.200
That’s not the way.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.450
Then you dishonor.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:56.509
You sit down with them, have a conference.

00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:58.990
“We’ll have a conference now,” you tell
them.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:00.509
“We’ll sit down.”

00:58:00.509 --> 00:58:10.380
So let them feel, let them sit on their chairs
like a conference hall, and tell them, “Now

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.290
see we are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:15.869
You are Sahaja Yogis, too, and the whole world
is watching you.

00:58:15.869 --> 00:58:18.089
You have to be honorable children.

00:58:18.089 --> 00:58:21.460
You have to behave yourself, you have to do
this way.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.029
We have to share our things otherwise they
will say you are not Sahaja Yogi.

00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:27.029
You have to have dignity.”

00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:33.580
You talk to them, develop their personality
that way, so that they know they have to be

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.599
majestic, they have to be regal.

00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:39.619
They cannot be cheapish like others.

00:58:39.619 --> 00:58:44.039
Because all the time we say, “Don’t touch
that, don’t do that.”

00:58:44.039 --> 00:58:46.549
They don’t know, they are confused.

00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:53.810
Talk to them, sit down, talk to them - what
is to be done, how we have to behave, how

00:58:53.810 --> 00:59:03.539
to say nice things, how to help others, how
to share your things, how to give your toys,

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:06.510
how to keep your things, how to be neat, how
to be tidy.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.930
It’s a training, that’s what you have
to do.

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:15.359
And children also learn from your own behavior.

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:20.339
Now you tell your children not to drink and
if you drink like a fish, then how will they

00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:21.339
listen to you?

00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:26.609
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also, you do
not meditate, you are not disciplined, you

00:59:26.609 --> 00:59:34.279
live in a very untidy manner, you are extremely
careless, you do not honor people, your tongue

00:59:34.279 --> 00:59:40.320
is very loose, or you are very sharp, children
pick up.

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.460
They absorb these things so quickly.

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.460
It’s amazing how children absorb.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:45.519
Once I had taken a child to a circus just
- he was a very good child, a Realized Soul.

00:59:45.519 --> 00:59:46.750
We went there and the joker, you see, he took
out his upper pant just while going on a swing,

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:47.750
so it was a big feat, you see, a joker.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:48.750
So we came home, he also took out his pant.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.750
I said, “Why?”

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:50.750
He said, “In the circus how he did I’m
going to do the same way.”

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.009
Imagine, that’s the only thing he picked
up.

00:59:52.009 --> 00:59:57.380
I said, “But that was a joker, you are not
a joker are you?”

00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.499
“No I’m not.”

00:59:59.499 --> 01:00:03.039
“And better wear your pant.”

01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:11.130
So children pick up wrong things because easy
to pick up that.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:12.999
So don’t do anything wrong.

01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:17.890
Another is husband/wife should never quarrel
in the presence of children.

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:22.859
If you want to quarrel I can even lend you
some sticks, you can fight.

01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:27.930
Fight in your bedrooms, do what you like.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:36.109
You can break the heads or break the hearts
or do what you like, but outside your rooms

01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:38.890
you are wonderful husband and wife.

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:44.960
At least let your children be good, enjoying
husband and wife.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:54.239
Actually it is stupid to fight because you
must learn how to enjoy each other.

01:00:54.239 --> 01:01:01.190
So we come from scholarship to the scholarship
about children.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.710
Some people have to take it up seriously.

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:10.289
Of course there is a little book which Louise
has nicely done up, but is not sufficient.

01:01:10.289 --> 01:01:16.569
Some three-four people have to sit down, or
some ladies could do it with some doctor there

01:01:16.569 --> 01:01:17.910
or something.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:24.579
Sit down with the full compiling of the ideas
of Sahaja Yoga about children.

01:01:24.579 --> 01:01:33.339
Another one can do the education, because
Sahaja Yoga will be boring for you.

01:01:33.339 --> 01:01:36.109
What will you do?

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:40.579
So much to be done about the education of
the children.

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:46.859
Is very important because every time I go
to a place, there’s a school being started,

01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:48.710
“What have we to do for the school?

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.349
How are we to conduct?”

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:57.239
Now why not you people make some research
and give Me the ideas and I’ll put it through?

01:01:57.239 --> 01:02:03.499
I’m good at correcting than creating, I
think nowadays, because so much I have created.

01:02:03.499 --> 01:02:09.079
Whatever I have created is to be rearranged
and consolidated.

01:02:09.079 --> 01:02:15.500
So I can consolidate whatever you give Me,
I can consolidate, I can put right, I can

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500
correct it.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.200
So best thing is now to form a committee for
this.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.829
One for children, one for book on children,
on Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:30.150
What Mother has to say about, you can use
My quotations.

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:35.569
Then a book about the education of children.

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:37.930
Third book has to be about the married life.

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:44.460
That’s how you can go on compiling, about
the social life, about the politics, has to

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.329
come from England.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:55.359
A series, so much to be done in England.

01:02:55.359 --> 01:03:00.859
Because people read that, it can be always
translated from one to another.

01:03:00.859 --> 01:03:02.390
Is very easy.

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:06.739
So I would request you all to put your mind
to this whatever are your interests you should

01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:11.440
work it out and put it in the language of
Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:19.239
Every sort - sports, you can take to gardening,
or anything, even machinery.

01:03:19.239 --> 01:03:23.430
Bring it to the level of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:27.930
Like computer, now all the developing countries
want to develop computers.

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:33.410
Now we must find out what are the problems
of computerization, then how it is going to

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:39.309
affect socially, deeply, in the future, what
can happen if we just develop computers and

01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:45.630
nothing else, how if it is one-sided movement
then how the whole suffers.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:55.000
Like that a new dimension, a new all-pervading,
solution of everything can be done.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.230
And that can be a quite a big eye-opener to
people who do not want to commit the same

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.489
mistakes that you have committed.

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:10.930
I must say this Affluent Society and all these
books that Galbraith wrote was very helpful

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:16.009
to some people, and that’s how it should
be.

01:04:16.009 --> 01:04:22.400
So you can guide people who want to be like
you, and you can guide the people who are

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.509
like you and who have to change.

01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:28.579
It should be your idea.

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:33.549
Drama - what’s wrong with our drama, what’s
wrong with that and how we can improve it.

01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:37.819
Everyone of you is capable of contributing
something like that.

01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:42.210
So those who are interested in different,
various type of things, in this seminar you

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:47.340
can decide what one likes and what another
thing - like even racial discrimination we

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.170
can take a subject like that somebody can
work it out.

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:54.960
Why racial discrimination has come, what are
the bad effects of racial discrimination?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.920
If it comes from English, they will say, “What
generous, good people there are, how they

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:07.160
understand the feelings and how they …” That
will be very soothing if it comes on the other

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160
side.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.499
Then now we have a problem of women asking
for their rights and all that what you call

01:05:12.499 --> 01:05:16.890
feminist movement - what is wrong with the
feminist movement, how they have gone wrong,

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:18.190
and all those things.

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:24.530
In every subject, even in economics and everything,
you can go forward with the scholarly ideas.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:28.700
You can take help from other countries also
who - we have scholars everywhere.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.950
But we have maximum number of scholars here.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:36.049
And this is what we have to do in this land
of She-field.

01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:42.960
May God bless you all.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:50.089
Should we meditate for about say, ten minutes?

01:05:50.089 --> 01:06:01.160
Will be good idea, just to meditate and to
find out what chakras are catching, to find

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.729
out what side is weak.

01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:08.700
Now if your left side is weak, put your left
hand towards Me and right hand towards the

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.700
Mother Earth.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:15.250
If the right side is weak you put the right
hand towards Me and the left hand up there.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:21.900
Now if both are all right, when they normalize
you put both of them towards Me, all right?

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:31.289
For example, now you can tell because you
are in east end, what’s the problem of east

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:35.140
end is.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.999
Survey it.

01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:41.270
You should find out the problems of east end.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:49.339
I remember you told Me about some Sikhs, what
they were doing, drinking so much and doing

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.820
all these things which is against, against
Nanak Sahib.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:59.130
And all these things if you tell, the way
they run after white skin.

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:03.380
Yes, that’s what it is.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:07.089
So face-to-face let us see what is wrong with
us.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.190
What is wrong with you?

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.930
With what is wrong with others?

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:14.950
Let us see as a witness, not identified with
anything.

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:25.130
So if you tell all those things you see - what
is that, what makes people that way?

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:32.920
You go into it from both the sides, and you
can give real good solutions, you can give

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920
solutions.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:43.500
For example there are doctors who can make
a book with the divine knowledge related to

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.680
the medicine.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:50.869
There are psychologists, they can make a book
- Gregoire I think, Rustom has done a good

01:07:50.869 --> 01:07:51.869
job, I don’t know.

01:07:51.869 --> 01:08:03.599
Now by the way I must ask who has got Rustom’s
book?

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:06.289
You have got?

01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:13.260
Derek you have?

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:24.880
Yogi: No I haven’t, Mother.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:34.180
I haven’t seen it.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:42.540
Shri Mataji: Somebody who is not here may
be having.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.740
Who else?

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.940
Ask Maureen.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.940
Is she here?

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:54.940
Maureen?

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.940
She’s not here?

01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940
Ask her maybe.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.259
Do you think so, Maureen may be having?

01:09:02.259 --> 01:09:05.299
No.

01:09:05.299 --> 01:09:17.460
I just don’t understand.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:31.810
I think you better see in your office maybe,
Gavin, just have a look, no?

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:38.839
Because I gave it to someone, because it’s
not there in the house, can’t find it.

01:09:38.839 --> 01:09:46.370
We had found his book, isn’t it?

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:47.440
No.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:55.020
All right, he’s a scholar, no doubt, and
I wanted Derek, you to read that because really,

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.760
it’s really dynamic.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.250
Dynamic is the word for that.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:08.780
You can blast all the Jungians and all the
psychologists together.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:15.150
I must find it out, otherwise somebody should
write to him that God knows where it is Mother

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:16.150
is very anxious.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:17.600
I must publish that book.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:25.090
So now if you come out with sensible good
books authentic, worked out, you have to work

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:30.160
for a book, you cannot just write anything
off hand.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:45.100
Like William Blake and Sahaja Yoga, relate
it to Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:51.030
Now before meditation any questions, is there?

01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:54.020
Did you ask any questions there?

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.659
No one?

01:10:57.659 --> 01:10:58.659
Any question?

01:10:58.659 --> 01:11:07.270
Yes, what is it?

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:22.450
[Yogi’s question is inaudible]

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:23.450
Shri Mataji: Loud.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:24.450
It’s so fast that it’s like Portuguese
to Me.

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:25.450
Can you tell Me Gavin?

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:26.450
Yogi: He is saying there should be some organization
by which it’s known whether any particular

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:27.450
one of Your speeches is being or has been
transcribed, so that there’s no duplication.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.450
Shri Mataji: There’s no…?

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.450
Yogi: Duplication of effort.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:30.450
Because he wants for Your speeches to be transcribed
from the tapes and he doesn’t want to do

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:31.450
one and it’s already been transcribed.

01:11:31.450 --> 01:11:32.450
Shri Mataji: Are you doing some… you’re
transcribing.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.450
Yogi: Not at the moment Shri Mataji.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.450
I used to worry – every time Shri Mataji
has a very nice speech sometimes I just felt

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:37.540
like transcribing it but I was worried maybe
someone is doing it already.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.050
Shri Mataji: What’s it…

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:56.430
Yogi: He’s worried that if he does the transcript
somebody else may be doing the transcription

01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:11.310
so it would be a wasted effort.

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:17.690
Shri Mataji: Agreed.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:25.120
Now who are transcribing - they form a group.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.030
You are transcribing?

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:38.330
Who else, will you stand up, you also stand
up please.

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:41.670
Now you know each other don’t you?

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:49.860
Yogi: Mother I’m quite prepared to take
a list because I’ve got a computer.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.200
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.160
Yogi: He said he can make the list on his
computer.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.240
To make a list…

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:01.190
Shri Mataji: Yes I think amongst these four
who are transcribing, all right.

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:02.860
You decide among yourselves.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:16.610
Yogi: But there are many more internationally
Shri Mataji and it should be advised to all

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:17.610
centers.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.610
Shri Mataji: You see in other languages, which
are being translated.

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:19.610
Yogi: Even in English

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.580
Shri Mataji: Like say Australia - whatever
I have said there in Australia they should

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.660
transcribe.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:28.920
That what I have said in England they should,
in every country whatever I’ve said should

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.290
be transcribed by that country, is better
to make it systematic.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.310
All right?

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.480
Is all right now?

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.060
So four of you here should transcribe whatever
I’ve said in England, which is going to

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.650
be a hard task.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:56.910
Some more people should raise their hands,
who would like to do transcribing.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:14:06.940
Please stand up, Derek and Louise, you take
down their names, take down their names.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:13.690
You give your names, write in on a chit of
paper.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:22.110
And now you form a group and tell them how
to transcribe.

01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:26.310
What else?

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:38.710
First of all you must understand My Indian
English, otherwise you can’t, or they call

01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:43.250
it King’s English I don’t know why but
they say so.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.622
Shri Mataji: Yes, how are you?

01:14:45.622 --> 01:14:47.290
Yogi: Getting better I hope Mother.

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:53.770
Shri Mataji: That’s good you look better,
thank you.

01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:57.040
May God bless you.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.980
What is the next?

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:16.290
It’s very, very constructive.

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:29.420
Now editing, once you have transcribed somebody
has to edit it also.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:35.550
Not like Indians - whatever when I speak I
say sometimes, “You see,” “Do you understand?”

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:40.610
All these things need not be there but they
think that nothing should be missed of Mother.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:42.820
But I would say that something is needed.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:49.290
I mean, you cannot go on just adding these
things after all, so we can remove some of

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:55.230
these things, this type of pauses that I’ve
used.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:57.040
Because talking is different from writing.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:09.650
But in any case when you do it I’ll have
to go through them, before we publish them.

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:21.290
But so many lectures of Mine have duplicates,
repetitions.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:27.950
So once you have done, transcription then
we can see that, we can adjust.

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:34.910
Sometimes certain things are to be said once,
sometimes twice, and sometimes hundred and

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:37.000
eight times.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.800
For example, “I am not guilty.”

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.720
All right, so any other thing?

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.410
This was very constructive I must say.

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:53.410
Yes?

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:54.410
Yogi: Mother in one of the Nirmala Yogas there’s
a little diagram which You have drawn of the

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:55.410
Kundalini coming up through the chakras and
going round two circles and then coming up

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.410
to the next one.

01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:59.890
I can’t find from it if the Kundalini is
coming up and going round and then continuing

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:06.930
up the same side or if it’s crossing over
at each junction.

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:16.910
Supposing I am doing the right side, is it
coming up and going round and continuing up

01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:28.060
the right side every time, or does it come
up the right side, go round twice and go to

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:32.170
the left, go round and come up.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:39.820
Shri Mataji: No it goes in a spiral way and
cuts it at a point, and makes a chakra.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.720
You see it’s a sympathetic nervous system
which is left and right.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.810
It goes in a spiral, all right?

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:53.750
And it cuts it at a point because it goes
in a spiral - that’s the chakra.

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:59.170
But I think we have done that in one of the
speeches, is so.

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:03.300
Once this is transcribed, that will be a source.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.770
Then everything I’ve said, all these things,
I’ve said it in very great details, you

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:11.640
will have to locate it.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:27.020
What else now?

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.020
What is it?

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.020
Yes, Gavin you tell Me?

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.960
Yogi: What is to be done with the water that
is used in puja, afterwards?

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:39.890
When we wash the Feet, what use is to be made
of the water, how is it to be dispersed?

01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:49.760
Say at home when we do a little puja and we
just wash Your Feet in the photograph, what’s

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.400
the proper way to dispose of it?

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.790
Shri Mataji: The photograph or Feet?

01:18:55.790 --> 01:19:02.380
Photograph, you see, that becomes vibrated
water, you can use for any purpose, you can

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:08.250
put it for trees, you can do all these things
external use, you can use for anything.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:13.310
But if you have cleaned the photograph and
all that and if it is a clean photograph then

01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:17.810
you can use it for drinking also, is all right,
can be used for drinking also.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:23.000
Because vibrations are such that they kill
all germs, everything.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.030
Because now for Ganges water we just drink
like that, no problem.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.460
It never gets spoilt.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.890
You keep it for months together never gets
spoilt.

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:37.400
Because falling from the head of Shiva never
gets spoilt, that’s the sign of the River

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.610
Ganges.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:49.530
Yogi: He’s asking what is Your advice about
fasting?

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:55.440
Shri Mataji: No, you can fast but not in the
name of God.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.500
If you want to fast you can fast but not in
the name of God.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.860
God doesn’t want you to fast.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:06.320
Nor does He want you to eat like a glutton
but, He wants you to enjoy the food, whatever

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.840
He has given you.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:13.080
It should be: you should pray over the thing,
you should give vibrations to your food and

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.080
enjoy.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.980
God has given you everything and you should
eat what is needed for you.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:21.310
But you should not starve, you should not
fast in the name of God.

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:23.430
Don’t torture yourself in the name of God.

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.950
That’s very anti-God activity, I think.

01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:29.410
Like poor fellow yesterday that Vivekananda
tortured him, imagine?

01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:36.210
He’s gone through all that for four years,
too much.

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:42.290
It makes Me really very sad that people are
tortured in the name of God.

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:59.430
Yogi: Should there be a magazine with all
the poems?

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.890
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have a magazine?

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.880
Yogi: He’s saying, “Could we have one?”

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.780
Shri Mataji: With the poems?

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:14.090
Only thing I’ll say, poems are to be very
much still to be put right.

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:20.440
Magazine for Sahaja Yogis is all right, but
if you have to put it out, then they have

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:28.921
to be little bit, brought up-to-date, I mean
in the sense that they have to be more, sort

01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:36.400
of, edited, and one has to work on them.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:43.850
And the poems should be brought out as magazines
but they have to go through proper understanding

01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:44.850
and things.

01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:52.730
Even sometimes people write funny, funny types
of poems also, like somebody will say, “Sahaja

01:21:52.730 --> 01:22:00.660
Yoga is my rice and Sahaja Yoga is my daal,
and Sahaja Yoga is my meat and Sahaja Yoga

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.290
is my fish.”

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:09.580
And I said, “Next will be and Mataji is
my food.”

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:18.520
You see they mean that it is everything, but
the way they express is sometimes really crude.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:33.440
Yes, there was a poem like that I tell you,
and I got a fright of My life you see.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.500
So, I would say that one has to be little
careful.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:47.680
You see there are two things always in expression.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.010
First is creativity.

01:22:52.010 --> 01:23:04.040
Of course, you have to be a creative person
but you must have the technique.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:12.730
If you don’t have the technique, then this
creativity looks bizarre.

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:22.720
So even if you have ideas, very poetic ideas,
you must have the technique of putting it

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.250
in.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:30.090
Prose poetry can be also very beautiful but
you must know the technique, you must know

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:34.010
the way how to put it across.

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:45.750
Like you may be a great artist as a creative
artist, but you must know how to put technically.

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:50.290
Supposing I am a great artist but I don’t
know how to handle a brush, how will I do

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:54.290
it?

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:58.420
So both things have to be there and that’s
what I think, that because of Sahaja Yoga

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.290
people are getting very creative and they
are feeling the exuberance and they want to

01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:11.060
express themselves but the technique part
of it is lacking, and the subtleties are lacking.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:15.790
So whatever poems you are writing is very
good idea, like some of them are very good,

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:22.870
but still I think there should not be any
crudeness in it, all right?

01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:40.780
So all those who are writing poems, who would
like to write, stand up.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.760
So nice to see so many poets around.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:55.690
All right so now, who will look after?

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.660
You?

01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:01.590
All right.

01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:11.390
You all know them, give your names to him
and send all your poems to him, all right?

01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:14.670
That’s it.

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:24.720
There should be nothing childish, cheapish
or anything like that.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:39.890
Then for art, all those who want to produce
pictures and paintings, drawings, please stand

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:47.060
up, even the children.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:26:01.380
Chris, you’re going to do that, good, and
your wife too, she’s very good.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.460
So let’s have Chris there.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:16.150
Chris will you be in charge?

01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:21.000
Please be seated.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.510
So it comes to that we have also two types
of people.

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:33.670
We have people who are intellectuals - easy
chair Sahaja Yogis - as we have politicians.

01:26:33.670 --> 01:26:35.730
They good at knowledge, scholarship.

01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:37.920
They know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.480
They write well.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:51.120
But there are others who are active, very
active, the young, extremely active, they

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.580
can work hard, they can do anything.

01:26:53.580 --> 01:27:10.040
That’s a very good thing, but I think we
should try to imbibe one quality that is lacking

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.430
in us.

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:19.980
Like a person who is an intellectual, or a
person who is a scholar, should try to do

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:25.380
other things also, like postering now.

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.790
So for postering they will not go, those who
are intellectuals.

01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:33.280
That’s not good.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.910
Or anything like that.

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:42.450
Those who are painting, they’ll paint but
not poster it, or they would not like to write

01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:43.450
the addresses.

01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:46.140
We should be able to do everything because
we are integrated personalities.

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:52.170
I mean I can give lectures, I can cook food
and I can wash utensils and I can clean My

01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:53.170
house.

01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:55.830
I can wash your clothes and whatever you say.

01:27:55.830 --> 01:28:03.390
Perhaps may be something I may not be able
to do I should say, many things.

01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:05.160
I tell you so many things I can’t do.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.630
You don’t know My weaknesses, there are
lots of things.

01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:15.910
I’m very bad at signing checks, useless
for banks.

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:23.080
Always the banks put Me into trouble, I don’t
know what they’re up to, and thank God Gavin

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.160
is quite aware of My weaknesses.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:33.200
So looks after that part otherwise I would
be sunk, bad at money.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:39.241
Very good at remembering if somebody has taken
money from Me, but if I have given something

01:28:39.241 --> 01:28:42.840
to someone I don’t remember, very bad.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.390
I give something to someone and then I don’t
remember I’ve given it and I appreciate

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:50.080
it, it’s very bad too.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.780
I do it very often.

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.990
I’m so frightened now I don’t want to
praise anything because mostly it is given

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.990
by Me - it’s horrid.

01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:05.750
It looks very funny isn’t it?

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:10.460
That’s one side missing completely in Me.

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:17.730
I’m very bad at say passports and things
like that and … what?

01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:27.300
Also, I don’t know about ticketing, all
these things I’m very bad at all these things,

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.300
you see.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:33.380
So that’s how you look after Me in that
part, is really I just don’t know.

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:37.500
I’m very bad at time, now I don’t know
what’s the time now.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.130
Very bad at watch, it’s always upside down.

01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:55.250
But there’s one thing good, that I know
Myself very well, and I know how to laugh

01:29:55.250 --> 01:30:05.040
at Myself, so I never feel guilty, I know
how to laugh at Myself.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.130
I can’t learn now, these things.

01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:12.280
I’ve learnt lots of human things but now
I can’t learn how to sign a check, where

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.870
to sign, what to sign, I’m very bad.

01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:17.700
You can get signature on My death warrant
also.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:21.670
See I’m like that, I don’t know I just
sign I trust and works out.

01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:27.220
So far nothing has gone wrong as such, much,
but this is what it is.

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:33.260
So doesn’t matter, one can manage.

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:38.280
And that is how one should look at oneself
- not to feel guilty but some things are missing.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:46.140
But if you can acquire, other qualities also,
will be a good idea.

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:53.700
And that’s what I think should be the attitude
towards Sahaja Yoga, that no work is below

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.700
our dignity.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:59.260
For some people have such ego, “Oh I’m
coming there why not I have a room?”

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:02.712
Such stupid people have nothing to do with
Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

01:31:02.712 --> 01:31:06.180
“I must have a special room, why shouldn’t
I have this?”

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:12.951
This is absolute sign of a stupid fellow,
is absolutely a sign of a person who has never

01:31:12.951 --> 01:31:22.310
known what is comfort, never known what is
money, never known what is luxury.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:29.480
Is something cheapish like a beggar who just
starts demanding, “Give me five shillings,”

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.900
then he asks for one hundred shillings and
this and that.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:39.330
All these things - the one who asks for things,
is not a king.

01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:51.740
The one who accepts whatever comes their way
is the real king because he’s mastered it.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.060
This is what is the right attitude.

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.920
That’s what a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:05.920
Who goes on grudging, grumbling about small,
small things is not a Sahaja Yogi.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:33:00.140
Sahaja Yogi is a king, he gives, gives Realization,
the utmost, the highest, all right?

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:02.670
What’s it?

01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:19.090
[Shri Mataji speaks with an Indian yogini
in Marathi - UNKNOWN MARATHI WORDS] She’s

01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:22.170
giving a very subtle point about puja.

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:27.860
That when we are doing the puja, say of the
photograph also, then we should have all these

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:33.570
things like a kalasha and all those things
there, we should not just do the puja of the

01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:34.570
thing - pratibha.

01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:35.570
So I’ve said.

01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:37.390
“You’ve come here all the way over here
to tell them these things they don’t know.”

01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:43.580
So all you see the deepam and all these things
should be there properly done, for the photograph

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:44.610
also, that’s in the protocol.

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:49.970
So certain things of protocol - now Gavin
is becoming a big pundit you know.

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:55.300
He’s getting a scholarship in puja business.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.480
So you better talk to Gavin, those who have
problems about puja, better ask Gavin.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.150
Yogi: Mother I was going to ask those who
know something about Puja should come and

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:03.900
tell me.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:09.500
Shri Mataji: All right some of you should…
they have to tell something you better go

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.770
and tell him also.

01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.650
Yes, good idea.

01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:16.110
Chhaaya has not come today?

01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:17.340
No.

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.570
She has told lot, then we have got…

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.120
now she has come.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.060
Shakuntala is here then we have got this lady,
we have so many who can tell you about this

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.530
and you can work it out.

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:32.430
That’s good.

01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:42.540
So scholarship of puja that should be, and
those who want to do puja now, stand up.

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:46.650
That’s too much.

01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:50.550
To know about puja, all right?

01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:51.880
Good idea.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.430
You ask Gavin, we should really have about
different marriages, how we perform, what

01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:01.360
are the mantras, what does it mean.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.960
All those things I think we should really
compile a book on that, good idea.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.040
All of you should support.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:12.040
Give your ideas, all right.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.040
Thank you.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.880
I mean in the sense you ask a question, “What
should be done?

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.110
What is to be done?

01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:18.170
What is good?”

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.830
So that he works on that and we find out a
common point.

01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:22.840
All right.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.670
May God bless you.

01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:30.960
Sit down, sit down.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.960
Any other aspect.

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.960
Yes?

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:39.520
Yogi: Shri Mataji, I was wondering what was
going to happening about building work in

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.380
Sahaja Yoga, sometime ago we discussed Golden
Builders.

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:50.880
Shri Mataji: You have, you are a registered
society, aren’t you?

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.530
Have you registered yourself as Golden Builders?

01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:05.550
All right, all those who are interested in
buildings and decoration and maintenance,

01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:06.550
please stand up.

01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:09.710
Vicky, what do you build?

01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:18.930
Yogi: Mother, the decoration side, if that’s
suitable and can be integrated into the building,

01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:23.000
the decoration side…

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:33.570
Shri Mataji: Really, then better give your
names to Vicky, all of you.

01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:39.950
Let’s have it because, you see, also I tell
you John, I gave him a good advice to John.

01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:45.800
I told him, “Take photographs of My house
and use it for advertising for saying that

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.380
this is the house we have done.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.740
This is what we have done.”

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.530
For example, you can do it by showing your
film the way that I have taken the photograph.

01:36:53.530 --> 01:37:01.260
I mean I have done this, all that you see,
and can use it as an advertising thing.

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:10.800
So that’s how you can carry album and say
that we are working with Golden Builders.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:20.940
Yogi: One other area Shri Mataji, music.

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:26.740
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.600
For music please stand up.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:39.280
We don’t have Banam here.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.000
Is he here?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.910
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:51.120
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.110
Because I have already asked him to do one
thing.

01:37:56.110 --> 01:38:03.790
So will you look after, all right?

01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:09.260
Can you all contact him?

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:16.800
Whatever is to be done about music, all right?

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.720
Please be seated.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.380
Now there’s one another aspect is photography.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:32.160
Photos, is should not be all filed.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.130
Remember what we have done.

01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:38.890
Gavin you have to get all the names of the
people who have… you should give to your

01:38:38.890 --> 01:38:40.420
leaders all right all of you.

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:45.360
Whatever you have said it, without hesitation
I would like to see.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:54.110
Now photography – those who take photographs
stand up.

01:38:54.110 --> 01:39:01.880
No, more.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.360
More people for photographs.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:13.110
Many more.

01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:14.290
Those who have…what are you saying?

01:39:14.290 --> 01:39:20.330
Yogi: Those who have taken nice photographs
of Mother, I thought they would stand up.

01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:23.690
Shri Mataji: Some of them?

01:39:23.690 --> 01:39:28.370
All right.

01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:32.390
Where is Don?

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:41.830
Yogi: He is making tea, Shri Mataji.

01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:46.030
Shri Mataji: He is making what?

01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:47.030
Yogi: Tea.

01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:48.030
Shri Mataji: So, all right.

01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:50.250
So Don … Harris will look after that.

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:53.710
Ray.

01:39:53.710 --> 01:39:54.940
You all should contact Ray.

01:39:54.940 --> 01:40:00.100
Give him your names.

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:09.440
All right?

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.300
Legal side is very important.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:24.910
So lawyers and administrators, just stand
up.

01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:29.850
No we have here, what about you?

01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:32.740
You are a Custom Officer isn’t it?

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:37.440
Better stand up.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:52.370
Anybody police officer, those who are dealing
with government?

01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:58.470
Yes, good.

01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:59.470
All right, you look after that.

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:00.470
Good.

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:01.470
You know him or not?

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:02.470
All right.

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:03.470
Yogi: Mother may I ask you one thing about
the important side of perhaps purchasing property

01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:04.470
through Sahaja Yoga and maybe the benefits
that could be obtained through use of the

01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:05.470
charity.

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:06.470
We don’t have any knowledge about it at
the moment, but in Birmingham at the moment,

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:07.470
we have made some inquiries and now Ray from
Derby, he deals with the legal side of many

01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:08.470
things connected with local government…

01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:09.470
Shri Mataji: Can you stand up.

01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:10.470
Yogi: …and he’s been most helpful in sorting
out our details referring to mortgages and

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:27.620
so on for us and has come up with certain
information.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:38.370
But also we’re anxious to know what benefits
may be accrued by Sahaja Yogis if we can use

01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:41.060
a charity to do such things.

01:41:41.060 --> 01:42:00.940
It seems that there may be some financial
benefits here and if we can get together some

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.940
information.

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.320
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.380
For this part I would say David Prall.

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:09.400
Where is he?

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.400
Stand up.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.700
Those who are interested, buying properties
and charitable things and all that, who are

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:17.700
interested?

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.700
Just get up.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:26.400
Where is Ian?

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:41.790
Yogi: Mother we have got some details about
the covenant thing from our accountant…

01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:43.050
Shri Mataji: What, details about?

01:42:43.050 --> 01:42:44.320
Yogi: Getting money on covenant.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.840
It’s very much beneficial, tax benefits…

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:46.860
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:53.780
So David Prall is to be informed about whatever
information you get, and to get from him all

01:42:53.780 --> 01:43:03.020
the information that is needed, and through
him we’ll deal in property problems.

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.020
All right?

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:10.900
So let us have a collective thing, all of
you should give your names to him, and everyone

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:16.670
who is now appointed as the person in charge
should give us a full idea.

01:43:16.670 --> 01:43:21.900
Any problem with your properties should go
to this committee.

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.260
All right?

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:35.760
Now, there’s one more aspect which is the
most important and the greatest headache,

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:44.230
is marriages.

01:43:44.230 --> 01:44:02.480
So this has to be somebody international and…You
are in that photograph group, all right?

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.090
Who is in charge of photographs, Ray Harris.

01:44:06.090 --> 01:44:07.130
All right?

01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:08.620
You contact him.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:15.100
Now make something positive, some plans positive,
make it something, let Me know.

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:19.570
There are photographs and photographs and
you don’t know where they are compiled,

01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:22.560
who has taken them, where are the copies – nothing.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.830
It’s all just, everywhere, all right?

01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:32.710
So proper filing has to be done, proper understanding
has to be done.

01:44:32.710 --> 01:44:54.300
For marriages Warren is the best I think.

01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:03.360
Now Warren you should stand up and now those
who want to help in making marriages successful,

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.670
in the sense in advising people, in making
them understand, talking to them, and also

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:17.680
organizing marriages, future marriages, of
people – like a marriage bureau – those

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.960
who would like to help.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.670
Some elderly people should come out for this.

01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:27.570
I would like to have.

01:45:27.570 --> 01:45:28.570
What do you think Manta?

01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:33.750
You not stood for anything, come along.

01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:36.820
Pat, where’s Pat?

01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.880
Who else?

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.510
They should be happily married people, in
a way.

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:50.170
Yes, good, Sarah.

01:45:50.170 --> 01:45:53.940
Yes, good.

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.880
There are outside also.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.460
That’s for children.

01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460
They will be for children.

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:02.260
Those who are outside will be for children.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:11.360
All right, so here they are, now please send
your names to him today.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.560
All these names must be given today, in this
seminar, all right?

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:24.920
Now for children, last and the most important.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:35.990
Call them.

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:38.140
You are a teacher, isn’t it?

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:49.940
You are teaching in a school.

01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:57.650
But just now we are thinking of starting a
school in Hounslow.

01:46:57.650 --> 01:47:00.060
But where do you live?

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:07.400
It’s too far away.

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.070
All right.

01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:21.670
Now how many of you who have children, small
children, and interested in them?

01:47:21.670 --> 01:47:23.380
Let’s see.

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:25.930
Now get up.

01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:38.740
All those parents who have small children,
all those parents who have very small children.

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:57.210
Get him please, get him.

01:47:57.210 --> 01:47:59.460
I think David is the best for this.

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.860
David will you take over?

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:03.300
Let David handle.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:11.030
All of you should contact David about it.

01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:19.260
Now all of you should sit down and only David
should stand so they should know.

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:26.820
You’ll have to also deal with problem children.

01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.850
There are problem children.

01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:38.970
Now we have to find out something where we
can deal with problem children.

01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:42.170
And about that I’ll talk to you.

01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:46.440
Those who have problem children, please get
up.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:55.480
She’s better, much better now.

01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:57.120
But what about you?

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.090
[Question from a yogi: is deafness a problem?]

01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:10.470
In a way, in a way it is, because it is to
be treated, all right?

01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:16.550
So, those who have problem children, also
must be dealt with.

01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:22.790
So you can have two things: where there are
problem children and where there are not.

01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:29.070
If they are catching, if they are still not
enjoying life, if they have little problems

01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:37.790
with them, or if they are catching from parents,
all these things are to be dealt with.

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:46.940
So on this point I have to say one thing,
when we have problem children is sometimes

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:52.900
the fault of the parents also or may be some
defect in them, or some sort of a wrong thing.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:50:00.510
Now under these circumstances, we have to
understand that it is the right approach of

01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:04.460
the parents can only help the children to
get all right.

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:09.340
So whatever is suggested to them and told
to them, they are not to feel bad about it,

01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:13.610
but to accept it and correct their ways and
methods and things will work out.

01:50:13.610 --> 01:50:15.090
All right, so that’s a promise.

01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:17.480
Nobody’s going to feel bad about it.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:22.860
Is going to take it up as a very good advice,
whatever we have to tell them, so because

01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:26.010
we have to pay special attention to this.

01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:30.160
Specially with ladies I have seen if you tell
them anything, they start crying.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.800
It’s a water power which I cannot overcome.

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.741
I don’t cry so much do I?

01:50:37.741 --> 01:50:44.250
I don’t know why people should cry so much
and upset everybody.

01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:47.190
So such people will not be allowed to cry.

01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:52.980
If they are to correct their children, first
thing they are not to cry and weep and sulk.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.910
Then only we can solve the problem, all right?

01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:56.910
So, done.

01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:57.910
This is also done.

01:50:57.910 --> 01:51:04.170
All right, let the children go out.

01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:06.770
Because the children still are not peaceful.

01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:07.940
We can see that.

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:09.120
They are very noisy.

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:13.490
They are not normal, so you can take the children
out.

01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:34.380
I think most of them are problem children,
because they cannot feel the vibrations.

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.620
You could feel, you see.

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:39.100
Did you feel that when they came in, the heaviness?

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:43.630
It was very sad.

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:49.690
Those who were supposed to do great jobs are
sick now.

01:51:49.690 --> 01:52:02.190
That’s because of the parents.

01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:12.590
I think now I can go or what’s the next
program?

01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:35.450
Yogi: Mother this evening we wanted to sing
something for You, some books.

01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:42.480
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.800
Can you hand it over to Me.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:52.820
What a very sweet thing you…what a sweet
thing.

01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:53.820
Thank you.

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:54.820
Lunch?

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.820
I don’t know.

01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:56.820
Am I supposed to eat lunch?

01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.140
That’s another thing you see.

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:12.260
I have not had lunch so far, I think so, you
know.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:19.420
So what song Gavin?

01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:33.120
Why not have I’m Your Rakhi Brother?

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:51.620
Yogi: There’s quite a big job to be done
on taping…big job to be done on getting

01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:54.710
all Your tapes transferred onto permanent
tapes.

01:53:54.710 --> 01:54:01.290
Did You want to appoint somebody to help Germail
with that?

01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:02.290
Shri Mataji: Where is Germail?

01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:06.040
I didn’t see him.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.760
Yogi: He’s coming in the afternoon.

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:17.050
We need people who are technically well who
are able to spare time each week to copy many

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:18.050
of Your old tapes.

01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:31.940
Shri Mataji: Those who want to copy My old
tapes and help, please stand up who know technical

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:38.810
ways of doing it.

01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:42.860
But we have only one machine.

01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:51.310
Can we buy another?

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:55.740
Yogi: The machinery is adequate, Mother.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.690
They’ve got enough machinery now.

01:54:57.690 --> 01:54:59.050
Shri Mataji: Only one.

01:54:59.050 --> 01:55:01.760
Yogi: Germail is well set up for copying.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.520
It’s the people we need.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.890
Shri Mataji: You have to come, distribute
among yourselves and [MARATHI] and there’s

01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:09.900
no Hindi speaking people here?

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:12.010
Chhaya can do Hindi.

01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:17.310
They can go there to the ashram and do it.

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:25.190
[MARATHI] So Ian is not going to be here permanently
but Germail.

01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:30.460
You must contact Germail, offer your services
to him and tell him that you would like to

01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:31.460
do that.

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.180
How many there are, who can spare?

01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.500
Derek you got up also.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.570
Can you come to the ashram sometimes?

01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:41.210
Yogi: I’ve got copying facilities in Cambridge,
Mother.

01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:49.340
They send me single tapes and I copy twenty
or forty at a time.

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.660
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660
Some people who can spare a day.

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:53.660
Yogi: One day each week.

01:55:53.660 --> 01:56:05.200
Come on, there should be a lot of people who
can do it, in London, at Chelsham Road.

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.990
Shri Mataji: Will you give your names to Germail?

01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:12.090
Some more people should come round.

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:13.230
It’s a tremendous task, you see.

01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:14.230
Yogi: All go back to 1974.

01:56:14.230 --> 01:56:15.230
They are all deteriorating and Mother’s
tapes are going to be lost if we don’t do

01:56:15.230 --> 01:56:16.230
it quickly.

01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:21.730
We also need to spend money on a digital recorder
to make it permanent.

01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:28.180
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:45.860
It’s very important.

01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:51.740
Children are in a bad shape Left Nahbi is
catching.

01:56:51.740 --> 01:57:00.590
Wrong with, something wrong with the mothers.

01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:02.210
What is it?

01:57:02.210 --> 01:57:11.170
Now what I’m saying, this is to be done
when I am gone, all of you, should give your

01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:13.480
names to…remember, I hope you remember.

01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:18.270
Because you stood up and sat down, stood up
and sat down, but now remember when you stood

01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:20.160
up, you see.

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.060
One may forget.

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:32.180
Yogi: He’s saying that there must be some
people who would be prepared to write articles

01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:49.570
about Sahaja Yoga for publication in the magazines
and newspapers, and we should make an effort

01:57:49.570 --> 01:57:52.360
on that line.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.360
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.360
That’s one side of it.

01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.440
Newspaper cuttings and things now, I was thinking
of John Noyce if he’s here, I don’t know.

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.440
Are you?

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.810
He’s the one who should be in charge of
that, John Noyce.

01:58:04.810 --> 01:58:06.100
Will you stand up?

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:09.260
Now will you stand up all those who want to
do that?

01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:20.880
Is compiling of all newspaper cuttings, from
all over the world, compiling all articles

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.620
which are to be published.

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:29.300
You mean to say in the magazines?

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:40.980
What did he say?

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:50.170
Yogi: He’s saying that people should start
writing now, for publication and that it should

01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:51.170
all be edited and sent in.

01:58:51.170 --> 01:58:52.170
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:53.170
That’s it.

01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:57.880
But also we have newspaper cuttings everywhere
which are to be put into one file and to be

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:58.900
studied and marked.

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:04.280
Yogi: That’s one job which is very good
for John to do.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.510
He’s very good at that.

01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:08.750
Another team with David perhaps.

01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:10.100
Shri Mataji: Now.

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:15.860
For David is for property and all that we’ve
given him one job, is sufficient to kill him

01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:16.900
with one job.

01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:21.920
But you can join him in this, I mean in the
sense you can belong to that party as well.

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:27.800
So now those who want to compile all that
is interviewed, all the newspapers, every

01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:33.440
cutting and also your own contributions, please
stand up.

01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:38.010
This is not only writing, but compiling.

01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:39.130
That’s good.

01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:40.630
Valerie is good.

01:59:40.630 --> 01:59:53.090
For example also we can say what we can do,
how to have our pamphlets and brochures and

01:59:53.090 --> 01:59:55.320
these are to be done up to that point.

01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.640
All right?

01:59:56.640 --> 01:59:57.950
That’s one.

01:59:57.950 --> 02:00:02.690
So we come to another very delicate thing
is contacts.

02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:04.070
Now so?

02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:06.240
That’s it.

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:15.170
Contacts with the television, and other publicity
things.

02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:22.550
Now whatever is our own publicity should be
done by John Noyce but to contact others and

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:23.550
all that.

02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:24.550
Valerie?

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:26.600
Yogi: What about John Glover, Mother?

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.520
Shri Mataji: Oh, where is John Glover?

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.810
No that’s for something else.

02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:38.620
But I was thinking Valerie is better for this.

02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:39.620
Will you take over?

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:40.940
Please stand up.

02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:48.950
Now those who want to go to the programs,
if we arrange some sort of a drama, something

02:00:48.950 --> 02:01:01.380
or we arrange anything related to the - for
the television or publicity anywhere else

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:09.550
outside, through other agencies, please stand
up.

02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:15.510
Good.

02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:17.950
Bogdan and John Noyce.

02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:22.640
I didn’t see Bogdan, where is he?

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.710
All right.

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:30.320
So you be one of the parties with them, but
leader is Valerie.

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:32.200
All right?

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:37.870
Please be seated.

02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:42.700
But remember that you have promised all these
things in My presence.

02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:47.380
Practically we have covered lots of things.

02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:49.350
Let’s see how much we achieve.

02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:53.760
So Paul what are you in charge?

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.760
Computerization of everything.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.430
Yogi: Not at the moment, Mother.

02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:00.040
Shri Mataji: All right.

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.460
You stand up for that.

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:02.460
Now here is Paul.

02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:07.390
Yogi: I’m pleased to say, Mother, that the
equipment we make is selling very well in

02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:08.540
India.

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:17.710
We’re selling Marathi, Gujrati, Bengali,
Tamil systems, everything.

02:02:17.710 --> 02:02:27.870
Shri Mataji: So all that sort of typing, of
computerizing, Paul is in charge.

02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:29.900
Now those who want to help him in that, who
are good at computerizing, giving ideas on

02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:30.900
that please stand up.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:31.900
All right.

02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:32.900
Who else?

02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:33.900
Germail, also Germail.

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:34.900
Good.

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:50.530
So now please write down all their names in
one paper.

02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:52.430
That you can tell later.

02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:53.860
All right?

02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:56.300
Brian has done a good job.

02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:07.880
There’s a series of seekers and actually
in one of the programs one boy gets Realization

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:18.220
in front of My photograph and they show My
photograph on the television.

02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:28.300
But that is in Auckland.

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:34.650
That is in New Zealand where we have a very
great dynamic Prime Minister.

02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:41.250
I think after Sadat, I feel he is another
person who is a Realized soul.

02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:47.590
I hope the Prime Minister here also gets Realization
or we get somebody who is a Realized soul,

02:03:47.590 --> 02:03:51.050
one of the two.

02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:54.760
I hope she gets it.

02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:03.470
Pray for it.

02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:06.330
So can we go now?

02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:11.150
What’s the lunchtime business?

02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:18.390
Yogi: Lunch is coming, Shri Mataji.

02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:22.010
Shri Mataji: Here?

02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:23.060
And nobody’s going to eat now.

02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.610
I’m the only person who is going to eat?

02:04:24.610 --> 02:04:25.930
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:27.580
Shri Mataji: All of us.

02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:28.890
Then it’s all right.

02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:31.000
What’s that Gavin?

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.950
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:44.900
Shri Mataji: Just … [laughter]

02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:51.860
Thank you very much.

02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:57.070
That’s quite heavy.

02:04:57.070 --> 02:05:00.550
All right.

02:05:00.550 --> 02:05:07.500
May God bless you.

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:10.390
You can open it and show them.

02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:15.960
That’s what they make here, and I mean there
was no need but they said I have to remember.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:25.470
I would in any case remember and but now that’s
their idea, what am I to do?

02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:38.130
Something that they make here.

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:51.330
That’s it.

02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:57.930
See.

02:05:57.930 --> 02:06:26.990
Oh what a beautiful design.

02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.990
Is in Sheffield?

02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:29.360
Yogi: Yes, made in Sheffield.

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:32.640
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful design, isn’t
it?

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.070
It’s better than what you showed Me.

02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:41.170
That’s the third one.

02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:43.740
Now we put it here.

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.260
It’s beautiful and this I will see every
day, morning.

02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:50.360
It’s beautiful.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:53.720
Very beautiful design I must say.

02:06:53.720 --> 02:07:04.510
You know we copied this in the… we have
got this design, we use it in Calcutta.

02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:06.930
Really.

02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:11.770
Believe Me.

02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:16.610
It’s beautiful.

02:07:16.610 --> 02:07:27.440
What a beauty.

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.750
Four pieces you got.

02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:33.520
It’s beautiful.

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:37.660
Look at that.

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:44.580
[applause] Thank you very much.

02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:47.340
Thank you.

02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:52.660
I thank all the Sheffield Sahaja Yogis for
such a beautiful gift and this I will have

02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:54.150
every day.

02:07:54.150 --> 02:07:55.800
Thank you very much.

02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:00.800
May God bless you.

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:03.480
You better keep it back into the box I think,
properly done.

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:04.740
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:06.350
You all can have a look.

02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:07.550
Let them see.

02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:10.600
The design is very nice and delicate.

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.160
Who’s got it?

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.720
Warren, you did.

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:18.370
Yogi: I got it with [INAUDIBLE] this morning.

02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:20.420
Shri Mataji: Really?

02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:23.830
No this I didn’t see.

02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:28.920
The one I saw was, it has that design you
know.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.010
That didn’t have any design.

02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:53.890
Yogi: They couldn’t get the one You wanted
so this is the replacement.

02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:56.501
This is cheaper.

02:08:56.501 --> 02:08:57.501
Shri Mataji: Really.

02:08:57.501 --> 02:08:58.501
Sahaj.

02:08:58.501 --> 02:09:00.340
It’s from the same shop.

02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:04.310
It’s such a beautiful thing.

02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:06.320
And also very sensibly-sized you see.

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:08.700
That one was a jumbo one.

02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.720
All right.

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:12.880
So should we have some music?

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:18.760
And, Gavin if you want I’ll eat, otherwise
I better go.

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:24.610
I don’t want to trouble you people because
I had a meal.

02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:28.180
No because … why to bother.

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:29.970
All right.

02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:34.450
So, let’s have this one.

02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:50.790
But 

02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:51.790
what a nice thing.

02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:59.110
I want to see the design.

02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:26.050
[TAPE CONTINUES WITH CONVERSATION AND SINGING
THEN:]

02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:32.630
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.

02:10:32.630 --> 02:10:39.220
Now, your suggestion.

02:10:39.220 --> 02:11:51.140
Can 

02:11:51.140 --> 02:12:06.750
you bring it?

02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:22.310
All right.

02:12:22.310 --> 02:13:18.050
Will you please go and get it?

02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:56.420
Yes, yes that’s great.

02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:58.160
Just go.

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:10.580
Those who have their instruments should go
and get it.

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:22.950
Pat has come I think.

02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:27.480
He is sitting outside.

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:30.880
What’s the matter?

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:33.200
What are you doing there?

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:39.490
Well, you better join our company.

02:14:39.490 --> 02:15:03.320
Take him in the builders.

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:33.800
[Marathi] Please get your musical instruments
if they are outside.

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:39.890
The faces of Sahaja Yogis are so different
you know.

02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:42.860
They look so different.

02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:48.090
Every one is a piece of art I think.

02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:51.520
So beautiful.

02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:56.670
What’s she saying?

02:15:56.670 --> 02:16:06.400
Yogi: There’s a new song written by Diane
from Sheffield.

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:09.010
Shri Mataji: Really?

02:16:09.010 --> 02:16:10.010
Great.

02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:11.630
Let’s hear.

02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:12.830
Now bring it along.

02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:14.000
Yes why not?

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.750
From Sheffield we should have.

02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:45.229
[MARATHI] She’s written a Marathi poem,
so I’ll translate it to you.

02:16:45.229 --> 02:17:14.760
She says that, “My child who is a Sahaja
Yogi is telling you, is manifesting knowledge.

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:24.969
I request you, everyone, that’s Me, request
you all of you, that I am the mother of this

02:17:24.969 --> 02:17:30.320
child, and you pay attention to him.”

02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:41.540
This is a typical, you see, a Indian, what
we call a kautuk, is the one where you handle

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:45.270
the child with fondness.

02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:48.520
You express the fondness for the child.

02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:55.150
Now so she’s describing the fondness for
the child, I have.

02:17:55.150 --> 02:18:00.849
My little child sonu they call it, is the
golden child.

02:18:00.849 --> 02:18:23.189
My golden child speaks with such affection,
sweet, what you say to the child’s talk

02:18:23.189 --> 02:18:28.010
– chattel?

02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:29.300
Is it a good word?

02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:34.880
I mean Sahaja Yogis having chattels.

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.490
We can say the beautiful talk of a child.

02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:40.469
You see child here meaning the innocence.

02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:50.330
He speaks to you with innocence, and listening
to him, I’m saying, to the people, listening

02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:55.010
to him, your attention will enter inside.

02:18:55.010 --> 02:19:00.309
It will leave all that is outside and will
enter inside.

02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:13.029
And 
to tell [MARATHI] Nirupan is the explanation

02:19:13.029 --> 02:19:19.729
of the Divine, but is said, it goes with My
word Niru, Niru is My name.

02:19:19.729 --> 02:19:28.349
So it’s a pun on the word Nirupan – pana
means the abstract of Niru.

02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:30.510
To talk about that.

02:19:30.510 --> 02:19:33.200
So there’s a word, Nirupan has double word.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:45.429
It also means to explain the abstract of Mother,
and Nirupana also means explanation of Divine.

02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:54.260
“Oh God, give him the blessings, I say.

02:19:54.260 --> 02:20:04.140
He is also in this world living like a ordinary
householder, as well as he has achieved a

02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:06.180
Sahaja samadhi.

02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:16.640
He has achieved the Sahaja, samadhi as you
know is the enlightened awareness.

02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:21.370
But he lives in the world, not given up anything.

02:20:21.370 --> 02:20:38.649
For the people who are ignorant, he has taken
the help of chaitanya.

02:20:38.649 --> 02:20:51.270
He is [MARATHI] It goes beyond English.

02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:56.489
[MARATHI] Let Me try.

02:20:56.489 --> 02:21:07.430
You 

02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:18.140
see you go on conquering, one after another
challenge to the ambrosia of Mother’s talks.

02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:24.779
Take Her name and you can do it.

02:21:24.779 --> 02:21:30.399
It’s very poetic.

02:21:30.399 --> 02:21:57.159
[MARATHI] In the eyes there’s light, enlightened,
and with that all the lights get enlightened,

02:21:57.159 --> 02:22:03.229
and the Siddhapurushas, the ones who have
achieved the Siddhata, the ones who are very

02:22:03.229 --> 02:22:13.300
great, higher souls have come on this Earth
now to see Mahayoga.

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:14.300
They are watching.

02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:22.830
Their spirits are watching this Mahayoga of
the children, of children that are Mine.

02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:23.830
All right?

02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:24.830
It’s about.

02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:26.880
I am not so good now I must say.

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:28.060
We’ll have to sit down.

02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:30.170
But Marathi language is very, very deep.

02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:36.569
To bring it out is very difficult but I have
tried.

02:22:36.569 --> 02:22:56.479
[MARATHI] Just put it for her little bit.

02:22:56.479 --> 02:23:14.030
[MARATHI - Poet sings in Marathi.]

02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:34.570
Shri Mataji: Now the last bit I just missed
the point.

02:23:34.570 --> 02:24:53.850
[MARATHI] the eyes lit in eyes of my children,
they’re the eyes you see, there’s a twinkle

02:24:53.850 --> 02:25:31.020
in your eye.

02:25:31.020 --> 02:26:02.520
The light lit in your eyes is that of knowledge,
and when it illumines the [MARATHI] What are

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:06.649
they called?

02:26:06.649 --> 02:26:11.109
What are called clusters of lights in the
Heavens?

02:26:11.109 --> 02:26:14.909
What do you call them?

02:26:14.909 --> 02:26:15.909
Constellations?

02:26:15.909 --> 02:26:18.710
Yes, yes, constellations, yes.

02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:29.039
And when these lights are enlightened the
constellations, as the great evolved souls

02:26:29.039 --> 02:26:36.869
have come on this earth as constellations
because the twinkle in the eyes they see and

02:26:36.869 --> 02:28:24.680
all of them have come on this Earth to see
the Mahayoga that is working through 

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:27.310
you people.

02:28:27.310 --> 02:28:33.270
That’s a good one.

02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:40.760
Very beautiful.

02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:48.109
Thank-you.

02:28:48.109 --> 02:29:27.949
[Applause]
You read it from there, on the…that’s

02:29:27.949 --> 02:29:28.949
better.

02:29:28.949 --> 02:29:53.660
Yogi: This song’s been written originally
by me but I had a lot of help from brother

02:29:53.660 --> 02:30:09.390
Sahaja Yogis in Sheffield and I need Gareth
Reynolds on the guitar.

02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:29.960
[Yogini sings You are the 

02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:30.960
Ocean.]

02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:40.450
Shri Mataji: Well done.

02:30:40.450 --> 02:30:48.700
[Applause] It’s a good one.

02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:49.700
Very beautiful.

02:30:49.700 --> 02:30:51.170
Very good one.

02:30:51.170 --> 02:31:36.760
Very well composed and very well done 
and it’s really, I must say, also musically

02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:45.779
it’s very well composed.

02:31:45.779 --> 02:32:01.590
May God bless you.

02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:05.540
Beautiful.

02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:11.210
That’s the quality.

02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:14.550
It’s beautiful.

02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:19.569
That is Sheffield.

02:32:19.569 --> 02:32:25.260
[Applause] Are you going to sing?

02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:29.600
You’d better go and eat, and if you want
I can eat also.

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:31.260
It’s all right.

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:33.499
So then music comes to a termination.

02:32:33.499 --> 02:32:38.850
I’m sorry, because they have to eat and
I have to go back to London.

02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:45.000
Hope to meet you again sometime, I hope so
before I go to India, I don’t know what

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:56.090
is the thing but Gavin is trying to arrange
a big program somewhere, again, hoping that

02:32:56.090 --> 02:33:07.390
in London we’ll do better and some people
will have some sticking plasters with them.

02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:08.600
So let’s eat.

02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:11.040
May God bless you.

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:15.920
What a thing you’ve found I must say.

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:16.920
That company is the same as the one we saw
is it?

02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:17.920
Same style, is it the same style?

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:18.920
Similar.

02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:19.920
Ah.

02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:20.920
But they had no guarantee, nothing and no
design.

02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:21.920
This has guarantee?

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:24.529
It has.

02:33:24.529 --> 02:33:34.640
For how many years?

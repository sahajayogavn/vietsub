00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:55.310
We had this Ganesha Puja, and I really spoke
very nicely on equilibrium.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:07.640
And the rain, expressed its equilibrium, but
when they were singing, it was very quiet.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.970
And when it stopped for a short time suddenly
it came with a complete gusto and sang some

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.730
songs and went away again.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.030
Just for the aarti to start with.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.840
It’s very beautiful it was.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.870
So dramatic.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.750
Very interesting.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:38.770
So all preparations are done for the puja?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.920
Maybe some people might come up from abroad,
I don’t know.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Maybe.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:02:00.890
Have you written to some leaders or not, about
this puja that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.680
we are going to have?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.899
Yogi: I think yes some invitations were sent
out.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.960
Shri Mataji: Might have gone out.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.620
Yogi: There are one or two people coming.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.030
Shri Mataji: They might come.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.280
Yogi: Only individuals.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.220
I invited a few people at Ganapatipule and
they said; ‘Oh, it’s such a long way.’

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.670
And I said: ‘But you always expect us to
come to yours.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.490
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.910
They have to move.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:17.890
Columbus could go to America, why not you
people go to Australia.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.160
Can’t understand.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:41.590
Yogi: And a much more comfortable trip.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:54.760
Shri Mataji: Much more comfortable.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:21.090
They found a much more comfortable place to
live in.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:31.630
He was really lost.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:59.120
But in a way thank God, you see.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:06:14.500
Otherwise there would have been no Indian
left in India, if he had come here by chance.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:32.229
So many flowers, beautiful.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:44.530
In Singapore I bought a book, very interesting,
called as: ‘Faces of Islam.’

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.949
And I was surprised that the whole concept
of Islam is Sahaja.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:52.949
Absolutely.

00:06:52.949 --> 00:07:04.780
And all the, authors and all the people, who
have discussed there, are saying that Muslims

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.050
are not Islamic.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.759
They don’t follow Islam.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.600
That’s why their whole thing has become
so rigid.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.940
I mean so surprising that book has revealed
to Me the confessions, of these people.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.940
And the society that Mohammed Sahib has talked
about is ours.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.940
Muslims are nowhere.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.880
Absolutely the way He has described how the
brotherhood would be there, how righteousness

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.130
would be there.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.780
But one thing is missing I feel, that He said:
‘You must seek the knowledge.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.080
You must seek the Truth.’

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.350
Despite that, whatever was Islam, they have
failed to seek the knowledge, and to learn

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.350
from others.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.759
Can you imagine?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.280
And He has said how to deal with non-Muslims
also.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.060
And they said that there are many who are
just minimal Muslims.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.410
Some of them are just for name’s sake, they
are not Muslims.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.610
I mean I was so amazed.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.449
We have such a misunderstanding, that I always
said that all these Incarnations and Prophets,

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:12.390
came to establish a religion which was really
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.550
All their expectations were Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:22.270
And they have deviated so much, that you start
wondering what is this, as in Christianity,

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.270
you see.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.970
How much it has deviated, Christianity, to
what level it has gone, it is shocking, really

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.970
shocking.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.779
I don’t know if you know of a book written
‘In God’s Name’.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:44.959
And in that book, it reads like a novel actually,
I mean it’s very interesting.

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:51.399
In that book the writer has suggested that
this present pope, is responsible for the

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.689
murder of the previous one.

00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:59.379
And there were thirteen or fourteen murders
took place, just to hide this.

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:01.180
Can you believe it?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.279
And recently one of the persons was murdered
was Calvi.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:14.249
And they say, that this Calvi was murdered,
I mean every week in Italy since I am there,

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:15.970
some new exposures are coming.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:24.619
But this Calvi was murdered in a way that
he was hanged, on one of the bridges of London.

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:36.249
And if he was, he was the one, the one who
murdered him, he said that: ‘I am a member

00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:42.410
of mafia all right, but I was paid by this
Vatican by this pope, for murdering that man.’

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.600
Is a confession from him.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:52.170
And Mr Heard was, questioned: ‘Why didn’t
you take action against this when these things

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.170
happen in England?’

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.199
He says: ‘What’s the use?

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:58.860
Because they would kill all our lawyers, our
judges everyone.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.300
It’s all mafia.’

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.739
So the whole system of Catholic Church is
nothing but mafia.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:15.579
Nine million, dollars of counterfeit, were
printed and were distributed through their

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:18.380
bank, that is Vatican Bank.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.410
Can you believe it?

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.799
I mean this is Christianity.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:26.269
Is this what Christ preached?

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:30.119
Killing people, doing all kinds of things?

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:33.480
I mean nowhere I find Mohammed decrying anyone.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.200
He said: ‘You have to believe in everyone’.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.239
Only these people are saying, that He was
the last.

00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:45.790
He went to this limit to say that: ‘I am
not Divine.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.480
I follow the Divine laws but I am not Divine.’

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.740
May be just He wanted people to follow.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:02.470
Surprising I was really surprised that, if
Koran is teaching such great things, the Muslims

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:09.269
are just on the other side of it and they
admit, that Islam should not be confused with

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:10.269
Muslims.

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:19.740
In the same way we can say that Christianity
should not be confused with Christians.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.250
What about Judaism?

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.930
Same thing.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:29.300
I mean nowhere in that religion taught, to
be like this the way they are behaving.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.480
They are following Hitler, out and out.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.699
The one who killed them, tortured them, they
are becoming just like them.

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:50.239
So what to say about these human beings as,
under the name of God, under the name of religion,

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:51.239
behaving like this.

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:55.120
The reason they have given many: ‘Because
of this and because of that.’

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:10.970
So, this aspect, that they are saying that:
‘Because the people didn’t read Koran

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:19.519
properly, they didn’t understand properly,
they should have been educated properly.’

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:38.540
It will take thousand years to educate every
Muslim about it.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:45.749
And if they think that by teaching through
their Book, it will be imbibed, it’s not

00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:46.749
possible.

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:52.609
Everybody reads Bible everybody reads Koran,
but nothing goes inside just reading reading

00:12:52.609 --> 00:12:53.609
reading.

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:57.929
So their idea is that if they read and analyze,
I mean you have to have big universities for

00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:08.160
that, it could be taught to people and, still
then not necessary, that they would imbibe.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.649
I know of Mahatma Gandhi, see He was a Realized
soul was a, and He was of course, over-disciplined

00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:16.470
according to Me.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.970
And He put these ideas on to His followers.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.089
As long as He lived they were all right.

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:29.449
As soon as He died, they came out in their
true colors.

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:34.910
Everything dropped off like some sort of a
mud on their body, and they became horrible

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.689
people in India.

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:42.569
So the thing missing is this, that, they are
not Realized souls.

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:47.459
Because they are not Realized, all these things
they cannot bear.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.360
They cannot bear money, they cannot bear power.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.269
Now I think they cannot bear the religion.

00:13:53.269 --> 00:14:00.139
So you have to have your Realization.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:03.829
Unless and until you have your Realization,
you cannot bear anything.

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:11.029
Moreover in Sahaja Yoga I mean there are no
compulsions, no disciplines as such, I mean

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:16.769
compared to what we see in all these religions.

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:26.759
Suddenly I find people coming up, to the expectations
of righteousness, goodness, and they are also

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:30.600
very compassionate.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:37.870
So the change has come from inside, that means
it’s the innate, change.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.720
The innate religion has been awakened.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.259
It’s not just forced on you, that you should
be Vishwa Nirmala Dharmis but you become,

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.480
you just become that.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.509
This is the point you will see, these Prophets
did not know, I think Christ did not know

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:57.249
that these people will never change unless
and until they get their Realization.

00:14:57.249 --> 00:15:02.879
I think He knew also because He always said
that you have to be born again.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:09.689
So when He said: ‘You are to be born again,’
they have a, brand you see again, one are

00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:13.959
Christian, another Born Again, another are
Seventh Day, another, something.

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:16.040
All just the same stupid people.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.649
But Sahaja Yoga is the only way.

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:25.829
Where what you, say that’s what you follow.

00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:28.910
Practice and precepts are just the same for
Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.470
They just can’t do it something else.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.759
They are dreaming also that the occident had
a very bad influence on Islam and all that.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.939
I don’t think it’s that.

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:45.329
You are coming from the occident, still you
have jumped into the right culture of religion,

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:50.109
when you understand what is righteousness
what is good.

00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.049
You can bear it.

00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:59.809
You’re not to be told do this, do that,
but in the light of your Spirit you do it.

00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:03.290
And you achieve it.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:09.759
It’s a very, interesting thing to note,
that a little thing was missing in all of

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:17.279
them, and they just went away as if they never
knew where to land.

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:20.359
All these religions, one better than the other.

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.220
Hindus, same thing.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.439
Hindus had of course one advantage they were
never organized, thank God, because if you

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:30.999
are organized and misled, then the whole party
goes astray.

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:38.540
But Hindus, Hindu scriptures were never organized
into a religion like that.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.079
But still, so many points they have missed.

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:47.029
Like it is said that: ‘In everyone there
resides the Spirit’.

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.269
Then how can you have caste system?

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:51.689
You cannot.

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:55.769
But they have caste system.

00:16:55.769 --> 00:17:03.799
So, also so many other rituals and things
nonsense is there, absolutely nonsense.

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:18.130
And Hindu religion became, a kind of a, ritualistic
religion where, the priests uneducated useless

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.350
priests became in charge.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:36.559
And they’re so stupid, worse than pope sometimes,
that they say that if you want to have…

00:17:36.559 --> 00:18:06.690
I’ve also found out a solution for children
our western children, what is the problem.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:13.490
I went to Japan, and what I found there, that
till the age of twelve years, they don’t

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:20.669
allow children to have much sports, to go
out much, and, mostly they are in the house

00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:26.539
or in the school, learning to do things with
their hands.

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:32.000
And medically I know that, till the age of
twelve years, there is myelin sheath that

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.830
grows on your nerves.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.350
And this myelin sheath gives you the deftness.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:44.430
Like if you go to the villages like [SOUNDS
LIKE: Saranti or all these?], where they are

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.640
producing artistic things, what happens, that
the children also start doing the same.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.430
It’s so easy for them when they grow up.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:58.049
So that is the time when they have to develop
that deftness.

00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:08.450
That deftness is, also makes them more concentrated,
they get involved into it, and also, that

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.029
you can never acquire later.

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:16.320
So that is just a precious time of twelve
years, that that is the time children should

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:25.159
be made to do some drawings, not at random,
but properly, to do some carvings, to do some

00:19:25.159 --> 00:19:26.200
other clay work.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:34.180
You’ll be surprised by the age of twelve
years, the boys in Japan could repair a watch,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.910
could repair televisions, and one boy produced,
produced.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.490
At that time when I had gone, there were not
many televisions also.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:49.340
I was surprised that the boy produced a television,
at the age of twelve years.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.470
And also they are given violins in their hands
when they’re about five years.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.120
They start playing.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.149
So the music, art and all this side is developed
till the age of twelve years.

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:06.830
And then the children are made to go out and
play and do all kinds of exercises and also

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.230
sports.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.370
But they are not let loose at a young age.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:19.529
Now here I think about twenty years back or
may be twenty-five years back a new theme

00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:27.049
started with children that, you should allow
the children to do what they like, let them

00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:30.740
express themselves, let them be free, this
that.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.780
I think it’s not proper.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.330
Otherwise they would be hanging from some
trees trying to do without parents you see.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.769
After all this is the way the parents escape
their duty I think.

00:20:41.769 --> 00:20:45.269
You have to tell children what they have to
do.

00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:50.940
You have to, talk to them, you must have a
rapport with them.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.370
You must talk to them, and you must also try
to guide them, with your experience, tell

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.730
them what is good what is bad.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:08.029
But this kind of a, thing that the child should
be allowed to do what they like, express themselves

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:09.340
the way they like.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.679
I’ve seen the western children always will
ask parents: ‘Why, why?’

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:17.549
They are not to know, they have limitations.

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:20.070
They can’t know every ‘why’.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.370
How can they understand?

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.429
They are limited and so, first of all, they
are to build up.

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:26.639
You can you see this aeroplane now.

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:34.980
Supposing it is not built up and allowed to
go because: ‘It’s all right.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.451
Let it go in the sky’.

00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:38.451
What will happen?

00:21:38.451 --> 00:21:43.009
In the same way we have to put the nuts and
bolts properly, into them, and see that they

00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:47.759
develop a personality.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:51.000
That doesn’t mean that you should be in
any way cruel to them.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Not necessary.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.760
There’s no need to beat them or do anything
of the kind.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.320
But only thing is, with love you should be
able to change them.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.470
And also dignity, sense of dignity should
be there.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.990
Because if you develop their sense of dignity,
they will not misbehave.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.390
That’s very important from childhood to
give them a sense of dignity, that they are

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.490
Sahaja Yogis and they have to behave.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:23.600
Because when we started this school one year,
first year, one month, it was such a problem

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.970
I mean, impossible situation.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:32.480
The teachers gave up and they wrote to me:
‘Better send typhoon take children.’

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.639
It’s terrible.

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:39.580
Not only that, they trouble them but they
used to beat them and bite them and do all

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.659
kinds of thing and make fun of them.

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:42.700
So wild.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:49.029
And that place is full of cliffs and full
of, all kinds of dangerous heights and they

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:50.470
would just run out.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.919
Just like dogs.

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:54.820
Dogs are better I would say.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.490
They had no caution about themselves and for
one month, they all gave up.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.230
And the Principal has now run away he said:
‘I can’t manage these children.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.770
They don’t want to study.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.360
They have come here to trouble us, that’s
all.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.269
They don’t want to study.’

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:11.540
And first thing when I met them they came
and told Me: ‘Mother, we don’t want to

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.540
study.’

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:21.590
Now we have put a one, masseur on them, who
massages their body.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.450
He was telling Me: ‘They are really funny
children.’

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.750
They don’t want to brush their teeth.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.030
If you ask them to brush their teeth they
start crying.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.049
They don’t want to have a bath.

00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:31.390
Tell them you have to have your bath, they
start crying.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.370
Anything you tell them they start doing like
that.’

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:42.299
So we can say one thing, that disciplining
children in a indirect way is very important

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:43.860
like that you see.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.549
Because this idea, that you should leave the
children as they are, is very wrong.

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:52.269
You have to guide them and tell them how to
behave.

00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:57.289
Now see, you must have seen Indian children
how quiet they are.

00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:59.559
But I think the attention of children is quite
a lot.

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:05.880
And the mothers are not working also, so they
look after the children.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.779
Now in our schools that we have here you should,
train them up that way.

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:14.730
You can talk to them that: ‘You are Sahaja
Yogis, you see, you are special people.’

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:20.700
The other day there was one Indian child,
he’s living in Singapore, where he has picked

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.529
up all these bad habits.

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:26.200
He came and he was talking to Me: ‘Grandma,
Grandma.’

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.950
And he said: ‘I will tell you in Your ear
something’.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.499
And he said something funny.

00:24:33.499 --> 00:24:35.580
I said: ‘Are you a servant?’

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.610
He said: ‘No.’

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.450
‘Then only servants talk like this.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.120
How are you talking like this?’

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120
‘Is it?’

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.120
I said: ‘Yes.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.809
This is how the servants talk.’

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:44.809
He got such a fright.

00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:47.580
He said: ‘All right, I will never talk like
that.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.580
It’s dirty.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.259
I’ll not talk like that.’

00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:52.179
You see, suddenly he changed.

00:24:52.179 --> 00:24:55.059
So we have to talk to them, we have to have
rapport with them.

00:24:55.059 --> 00:25:01.029
After all they are born Realized so they have
special powers and they are special children.

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:07.840
But, one thing is definite, that children
cannot be avoided, and you cannot avoid your

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.149
duty towards your children.

00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:15.129
You have to look after them because, they
are in your trust as it is.

00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:17.639
They are after all born Realized children.

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:20.159
They are special children with tremendous
brains.

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:26.250
They are cleverer than you and they can outwit
you, because they are so clever, so intelligent.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.299
But if they get spoiled at this age, then
later on it will be very difficult to bring

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:32.630
them…You were better, because you were not
born with Realization.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.510
So you understood the value of Realization.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.510
But they don’t.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.620
So they are to be told that: ‘You are Realized
children, God sent you here, you are special

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.539
children,’ and what should happen.

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:48.289
Gradually they will pick up, and understand.

00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:53.309
Of course I am happy that so many marriages
are successful, and people are behaving all

00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:54.309
right.

00:25:54.309 --> 00:25:56.700
Of course there are some stray cases of fighting
going on which I hear about.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.190
This is stupid of course again, that we should
fight.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.179
When we are both Sahaja Yogis, what is there
to fight?

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:06.740
I mean, there’s no question.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.210
We believe in all the religions, so we can’t
fight on religions.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:22.710
On what subject can we fight, I just don’t
know.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:28.059
We know the ethics of Sahaja Yoga and we like
it, so we cannot fight on ethics.

00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:33.110
Economics of Sahaja Yoga we understand, we
cannot fight on that.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:40.190
I just don’t understand what is the, point
of difference where they start fighting.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.840
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, you can really
be, enjoying your married life.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.769
Should be enjoying your married life and the
children should see to it, that our parents

00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:53.610
are so nicely, quietly settled down.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:59.309
But if they see you quarreling, next day they’ll
be quarreling too.

00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:02.320
Then we have only monogamy.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.809
We don’t have three wives or four wives
as the Muslims have.

00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:11.139
We don’t have four husbands or something
like that.

00:27:11.139 --> 00:27:17.179
We have simple monogamy, a very peaceful life,
very beautiful life, then why should there

00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:19.629
be problem between husband and wife?

00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:26.240
Culturally we are just the same, we believe
in all the good cultures of all the world.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.789
There’s no problem.

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:35.700
One gentleman told Me that: ‘My wife quarrels
with me on one point.’

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.700
I said: ‘Which?’

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.950
She said: ‘You do not meditate, you must
meditate more.’

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.950
I said: ‘That’s a good point’.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.950
He thinks as well.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:49.870
But I told the wife that: ‘You need not
tell him, he’ll do it on his own.’

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.490
Because you see cannot force things.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.030
This has to work out by themselves.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.619
You must accept them as they are.

00:27:55.619 --> 00:28:03.159
Gradually they’ll all improve and gradually
they will get there.

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.340
You cannot just force them.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.539
We cannot just tell each other, do this way
or that way.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:13.740
Sahaja Yoga is a thing is to be imbibed.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.840
People don’t understand that.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.509
They think by forcing people, by jumping at
them, that’s not the way.

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:30.919
Of course if somebody is very difficult, then
we have divorce in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:34.470
We have not banned divorce as in the Catholic
religion or anything.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.499
There is divorce.

00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:38.659
But there should be something sensible about
it.

00:28:38.659 --> 00:28:39.789
One has to work it out.

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:44.730
Normally there should not be many cases of
Sahaja Yoga, of divorce.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:50.062
But we have because of the background certain
types of funny relations they have had or

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:55.039
I don’t know, what to say.

00:28:55.039 --> 00:29:01.669
On the whole, ninety percent or I should say
ninety-five percent marriages are quite successful,

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:07.440
and will be more now the number will be much
more, I’m sure.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.070
This time we had seventy-six marriages, so
you can imagine.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:17.860
And in this one month, Yogi was after My life
with his file there.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:24.629
So there, also there’s some misunderstanding
that Yogi decides, he does not, poor man.

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.019
He cannot.

00:29:26.019 --> 00:29:31.820
But it happens sometimes, like at the last
minute they’ll bring somebody, now we cannot

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:37.550
locate the name of that person, we just can’t
find out if he’s there or not, or she’s

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.550
there or not.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.610
Suddenly they bring somebody, and he may say
or she may say that I am there on the form

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.610
and all that.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.200
Then you have to accept it.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.759
If you accept such a thing then what happens
that, you find that person is not a Sahaja

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:55.249
Yogi or was not a Sahaja Yogi for such a long
time.

00:29:55.249 --> 00:29:56.440
Something like that.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.190
So because of three hundred to four hundred
requests you see, what can we do.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:07.779
I mean after all, can’t know who is who.

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:11.090
This is one thing that is very good.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.210
At least we can control all that.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:21.870
If something is wrong we can find out, we
can work it out and we can manage things.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.070
It’s not so difficult.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:29.759
But the leaders must be careful because the
leaders who recommend should not, do something

00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:35.440
out of just some sort of a pity, or some sort
of a consideration.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.710
The main consideration should be, how are
the vibrations and what is the commitment

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.909
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:46.830
If they are committed to Sahaja Yoga and if
their vibrations are all right, then it’s

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.350
all right it’s perfect.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:54.929
But sometimes, you know, some people do have
problems which do not come up and later on

00:30:54.929 --> 00:30:56.190
it is discovered.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:01.360
Still, I am so happy our society is so great.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.799
There’s no such society existing in the
whole world.

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:10.840
And this is the society I think all these
Prophets and everybody dreamt of, of such

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.539
love, understanding.

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:21.239
Gradually I think we all will, grow and grow
and grow.

00:31:21.239 --> 00:31:29.860
The growth is going on, but the atmosphere
I must say is very nice, and it helps each

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.860
other.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:44.059
In Australia we had more problems in Melbourne,
not in Sydney I must give credit to your leader

00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:52.169
here, he has managed the things well.

00:31:52.169 --> 00:31:58.080
There are many after him also it’s rather
funny but, I just don’t know, because Australia

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.929
always had a problem, this kind and gradually
we have sorted it out.

00:32:03.929 --> 00:32:08.909
It’s a, leadership means nothing but I call
it hocus-pocus.

00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:11.909
It has no meaning at all.

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:14.730
But then somebody has to be there to contact
and all that.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.460
It’s something so limited.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:24.929
But there is jealousy, there is all these
things still, lingering behind and then the

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:27.480
problems come in.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:39.220
Gradually I am sure all of us will grow well
and everything will work out, in a proper

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.220
way.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.220
Should work out in a proper way.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.110
Our society has to show to the world that
there can be a society like this.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:52.529
Now there’s a good news which is very good
I think, we can start the calendar from that

00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:59.269
date perhaps because such a transformation
is coming, that the Russian Embassy has invited

00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:19.769
Me to honor Me for the work I 

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:20.769
have done in Russia.

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:23.940
And the another good news is that Gorbachov
wants to meet Me.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:43.580
And you must be aware that in Tagliatti, is
one place, Tagliatti which is an industrial

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:49.470
town where a gentleman called [SOUNDS LIKE:
Pagliati] from Italy went down, he was a revolutionary.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:59.489
And he started this place called as Pagliati
and the best motorcar that they make is made

00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:01.779
in this place Tagliatti, beautiful one.

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:05.471
They gave Me a model here, very beautiful,
quite big.

00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:06.799
Looked like a limousine sort.

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:08.090
Quite big.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:14.119
And in that one city we have twenty-two thousand
Sahaja Yogis practising, twenty-two thousand.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:21.649
And you’ll be amazed that in Russia nowhere
is less than sixteen thousand people, nowhere.

00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:31.710
Any time you go there at least sixteen thousand
people practising Sahaja Yoga, very seriously.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.929
So can imagine in that country what is going
to happen, though it hasn’t got food as

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:46.109
you have here, too much to eat, but still
look at the way, look at the way it has worked

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:47.109
out.

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:48.290
How deeply they have gone into it.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.450
They had never heard a word about Ganesha.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.809
They never believed in God.

00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:56.179
They were in a way atheist.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.069
And how much they have achieved in just…look
at that.

00:34:59.069 --> 00:35:00.069
How did they achieve that?

00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:06.470
The depth that they have, they just touched
it.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.670
And also they invited some scientist, or two
hundred scientists were there.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.829
And when I started telling about science,
said: ‘Mother, don’t tell us about science,

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:17.119
had enough of it.

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:20.780
Now please tell us about Spiritual science,
spirituality.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.780
That’s it’.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.050
Wonderful I tell you, such experiences.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.520
And in My lecture only, just giving a lecture
at the time when there were about sixteen

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:33.290
thousand to eighteen thousand people, people
got cured, just got cured.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.290
Such wonders.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:40.800
There was one lady who came to see Me after
the lecture and she was just sitting in front

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800
of Me.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.900
They brought her on a wheelchair.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.960
She said: ‘I couldn’t even sit.’

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.960
All right.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.549
And then I said: ‘You are all right,’
She said: ‘Really?’

00:35:47.549 --> 00:35:48.630
I said: ‘Yes.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.109
You get up.’

00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:51.109
Got up.

00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:57.099
She started walking and then she started running
and everybody started…

00:35:57.099 --> 00:35:58.099
Such faith.

00:35:58.099 --> 00:35:59.099
Such faith.

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:01.849
And in Czechoslovakia, there was one old lady.

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:07.549
They brought her with great difficulty just,
held her out and brought her on the stage

00:36:07.549 --> 00:36:10.109
and she was trying to sit down.

00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:15.300
Then she said: ‘Mother I have complete faith
in You.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.049
I know You can cure me.’

00:36:19.049 --> 00:36:20.480
I said; ‘Really?’

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
‘Yes.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.790
I am sure You can.’

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.380
I said: ‘You are cured.’

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.380
She got up.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.380
Everybody was surprised.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.380
I said: ‘Now walk.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.380
Walk now.’

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.380
And then she started walking fast, and everybody
started laughing.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.319
But that faith, you see, is something so special.

00:36:38.319 --> 00:36:44.640
I mean I have seen so many miracles happening
with this faith that…

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.640
There was one fellow called Mr Shukla, who
is a big boss in this hotel management of

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.410
Taj Mahal.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:37:00.240
And this Mr Shukla heard that his mother was
very sick she was going to die.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240
Very serious.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:07.859
So he went to Rotak which is very far away,
beyond Delhi from Bombay, and he saw his mother

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:10.380
in a very bad condition, very painful.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:17.580
The doctor said she has a galloping cancer
and at the most she can live for three days.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.140
He got very much worried.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.380
He came back home.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:26.160
He thought that: ‘I couldn’t even talk
to my mother, she’s in a coma, what will

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.470
happen to her.’

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:33.140
He just sat before My Photograph and prayed:
‘Mother, please cure my mother.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:38.910
I don’t want anything just now, You just
cure my mother, I know You can cure her.’

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:43.280
And within three days before, instead of dying
she was out of the hospital.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.260
He brought her to Bombay.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:51.620
They took her to the hospital of Thata, Thata
Memorial Hospital we have, and when they examined

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.870
her they said she has no cancer.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.610
He has papers.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.380
He has papers from the first hospital and
from this one.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.250
Recently, Rajesh told me a story about himself.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.140
He said: ‘Mother, You don’t know how many
powers You have given me.’

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.980
I said: ‘No it’s your faith.’

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.970
His uncle was just dying.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.099
They had removed his oxygen and everything.

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:16.940
His aunt sent for him and she said: ‘Now
he’s about to die.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.910
You pray for his salvation, at least to Mother.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:27.910
Just somehow or other try to see that he’s
also gets his salvation’.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.530
He’s not a Sahaja Yogi uncle nothing of
the kind.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:40.630
So Rajesh just had his pendant, just twisted
it, and then closed his eyes and prayed: ‘Mother,

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.540
please cure my uncle.’

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.540
That’s all.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:50.200
He said it was too much of a venture to say
but I did say.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.760
And the uncle who was dying got all right,
went to America and he’s back and still

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760
kicking.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.010
So this is something you see.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.190
We have to go deep down into ourselves.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.720
Superficiality is not going to help.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.950
If we are superficial by nature, it will not
help us.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.060
We have to understand ourselves.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.900
The whole mechanism is within us to attract
the attention of this all-pervading Power,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.390
to use it, to work it out.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.510
We can do marvels.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:28.180
If we really go deep down, and become good
vehicles of that all-pervading Power.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.310
That’s what we have to do.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.730
Everything can work out.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:39.270
There are so many examples of this, but specially
these two recently I heard about and, I was

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.270
amazed.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:45.530
We have to have that depth within us to understand:
What are we doing?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.010
Where are we?

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.980
We are born at this time.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:56.089
It’s an important time, and that at this
time, we have got Self-realization.

00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:59.290
Very few people got it.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:06.030
Not only that, we have been blessed with so
many things.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.980
But above all we are so powerful.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:15.310
And all these powers must be manifested, must
be used, must be worked out.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:25.540
And this superficiality of living on a very
mundane style is not going to help us.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.089
We have to really go deep down into ourselves.

00:40:28.089 --> 00:40:30.730
I mean you are seekers, no doubt, you are
seekers of truth.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.190
And you have found it also.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.470
How many have found it?

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:42.050
So many are already lost if you see as hippies,
as this, as that, as TM, as another this Rajneesh.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.670
I’ve seen some other lady here, two months
she came.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.559
How much she was caught up.

00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:48.880
She was just worried.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.059
So many are lost like that.

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:54.289
But you are the people who have got the knowledge,
you are God’s people, you have got the truth

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:59.400
with you, and all these powers are within
you, but you must use them.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.140
But I’ve seen even after coming to Sahaja
Yoga some people get lost in the temptation

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.690
because they get money.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.740
Some people get some talents, they get lost
in the talents.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.640
Some people get some powers, they’ll get
lost with them.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.599
That’s not the way.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:24.369
You see if God has given you this Realization,
He expects you, to give Realizations to others,

00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:25.369
to go deep down into your Self.

00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:32.589
This is what we have to do is to really work
out, our depth.

00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:33.589
It all exists within us.

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:34.589
You never knew there is Spirit within us.

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:35.589
Is there.

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:36.589
You never knew there is Ganesha within us.

00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:37.589
Is there.

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:44.089
And when you started awakening them, you found
it works, it works.

00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:49.849
It has worked such wonders, health wise, wealth
wise, in every way.

00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:52.839
But spiritually, how far we are?

00:41:52.839 --> 00:42:01.390
How do you judge a person who is spiritually
evolved, is that, even a desire works out.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.860
Any, desire works out.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.360
And such a person doesn’t have any funny
desires.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.710
Absolutely it works out.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:19.230
And that’s what I want Australians to do
because you are special people born in this

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.220
country of Ganesha.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:28.539
Perhaps we forget sometimes that you are born
in the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:31.549
Very special people [INAUDIBLE: you are?].

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:32.549
Very special.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:35.049
So have respect for yourself.

00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:40.210
And also must, manifest your glory.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:46.119
That otherwise, of all the places from Russia,
Sahaja Yoga will spread, it’s not, I mean,

00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:47.339
never expected that.

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:52.569
But it may, it may I tell you they are so
deep, so very deep people.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.859
Extremely deep.

00:42:53.859 --> 00:42:57.079
I don’t know what has given this.

00:42:57.079 --> 00:43:01.260
Materialism I think is responsible for our
superficiality.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.260
They are not materialistic.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.900
About thirty percent people are materialistic,
the rest are not.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:11.180
They are all seeking the spirit in the real
sense of the word.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.450
Not just for fashion.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.070
Very remarkable.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.690
Very loving.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.310
Very beautiful.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:27.849
I was there, they came.

00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:35.369
They arranged that, from one place, some people
will come only for two days then two days.

00:43:35.369 --> 00:43:41.500
And where I had purchased a little cottage,
they, there are some places where they can

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.980
live in a small little huts like that.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.940
They all came and stayed there.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.940
I didn’t know where they were living or
anything.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:53.380
Early in the morning they would come, bring
some flowers, and plant the flowers in the

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.510
garden, flowers, itself.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.550
And would not say anything and go away.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.440
Sit down for meditation.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.770
One day suddenly I discovered all of them
sitting there meditating.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.770
So surprised.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.160
And then it was this Gorbachov problems came
up.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.869
So I said: ‘Now what are you going to do?’

00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:12.549
‘What are we doing?

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:17.440
We are in the kingdom of God.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:26.109
Why should we worry about Gorbachov or anyone,
why should we?’

00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:27.109
We are not worried.

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:28.109
Beautiful people.

00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:29.109
Beautiful.

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:30.109
Very collective.

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:31.200
Also this is the blessing of, communism they
are very collective.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.070
I have seen that also in Calcutta.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.070
People are extremely collective.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.070
They don’t talk ill of others.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.599
Very collective people.

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:44.660
It’s not like: ‘Come to my house.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.839
Oh You must visit.

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:47.970
This thing, this is my daughter...’

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.980
That ‘my-ness’ I didn’t see, in Russia
and in Calcutta.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:51.980
I was surprised.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.849
Calcutta also has communistic, communist government.

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:57.510
How it has worked out, I can’t say.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.510
So are you spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:59.510
How many people give Realization?

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.050
Yogi: [INAUDIBLE] We all do it together collectively.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:10.190
Shri Mataji: Now you are doing.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:19.319
You all have to do it.

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:23.890
It’s very important.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:39.670
All of you should ask this question: ‘What
have I done for God?’

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:44.500
Look at these flowers that you brought.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.260
They are so fragrant.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.020
They are so beautiful.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.500
They are going to live for a very short time.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.500
But what pleasure.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.560
What expression of your love they give.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:08.740
How beautiful they are.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.230
Australians have a very big role to play.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:59.860
As I expect from Ganesha, I expect from you
also.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.589
Yogi: …from Hong Kong, from Alex and Kate.

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:17.720
And they managed to get some editorial in
the newspaper, for their programs as a run-up

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720
to your visit.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.609
And in the first program they got sixty Chinese
people, very good quality people.

00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:27.900
Shri Mataji: Oh Look at Alex. Alex is really
special I must say.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.730
Such a beautiful boy.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:38.339
When his mother died, and he was staying with
Me, so I said: ‘Alex won’t to go to your

00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:39.339
mother?’

00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:40.440
So he said: ‘Mother, there’s no seat available.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:48.039
Will take about four, five days to get a seat
by the time it goes on.

00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:51.490
So what is the need.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.250
I am with You.’

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.010
Said: ‘You did try?’

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:03.400
Said: ‘I did little bit, not much, because
I saw You, and I knew that my mother will

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.980
have Eternal life, so why should I worry.’

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:14.730
Now he’s saying that Alex has got sixty
Chinese people in Hong Kong.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:28.309
I couldn’t get even one.

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:32.010
Chinese are another one.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:41.020
If Sahaja Yoga gets into their heads, they’re
very traditional, very, very deep, very deep

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.869
people, Chinese.

00:48:42.869 --> 00:48:51.930
The Prime Minister of China, I met him when
I went there, in a photograph he’s just

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.829
next to Me standing.

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:57.609
After that he became Prime Minister, not that
time.

00:48:57.609 --> 00:48:59.599
A very nice man.

00:48:59.599 --> 00:49:04.549
And he was asking Me about spiritual life,
all the time.

00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:06.430
I showed complete ignorance, you see.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.569
I said these communists God knows what they
are up to.

00:49:10.569 --> 00:49:11.569
I didn’t tell him.

00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:13.599
But I think we can approach him now.

00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:21.140
Somehow or another they got very fond of Me,
all the Chinese government and all.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.140
Somehow.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.970
Some sort of an auspiciousness they felt about
Me.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:31.579
I couldn’t understand them, what made them,
respect Me so much.

00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:43.319
They had one exhibition, one which they had
invited Me and My husband, and I couldn’t

00:49:43.319 --> 00:49:46.250
go at this point.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:52.420
And, the next day was closed, that exhibition
must be closed but they kept it open for Me

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420
alone.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.990
And they said: ‘You must see the exhibition,
it’s important.’

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:03.690
I don’t know, they have their own ways of
understanding.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.569
We had Confucius there.

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:15.980
They follow more Confucius now, our Confucius
who has talked about general well-being and

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.599
all that.

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:25.150
But not so much about Tao, that they don’t
talk.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:31.349
But they are extremely humble Chinese.

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:32.829
Very humble.

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:36.690
You try to praise them and they say: ‘No,
no.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.119
We have to do much better than this, nothing.’

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:50.740
They can never get pampered you see, you couldn’t
praise them, never.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:51:01.589
They are very much like Russians, in so many
ways.

00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:19.869
I can see Sahaja Yogis here.

00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:27.180
Any questions?

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:37.059
Tania is very happy with her husband.

00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:38.480
Very happy.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.710
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji she’s happy.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:46.240
Shri Mataji: She’s very happy.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.890
Yogi: Mother did you know she has hepatitis?

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.420
Shri Mataji: She has what?

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.829
She too?

00:51:56.829 --> 00:52:01.589
I’ve told him what is the thing.

00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:08.359
Can you fax to Dr Spiro?

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:11.750
[HINDI EXCHANGE] Faxes.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:17.690
She is on the liver… or her husband, was
just like a child.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:23.450
But see him when he sings, absolutely.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:24.490
Remarkable.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:33.810
There’s that one with a super- intelligence
I see.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:34.839
Wonderful.

00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:40.480
She’s happy because she can come to pujas,
we are now there.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.110
She is very happy about that.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.140
She’s happy in Spain also.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.370
Italians are better but not Spanish people.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:53:00.450
Spanish are little [INAUDIBLE] I think this
American conquering has reflected in their

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:01.760
character.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:10.480
There are also some misunderstanding of people
think that I have said that the men should

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.299
dominate women.

00:53:12.299 --> 00:53:13.569
Never.

00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:22.730
I am Myself a woman and then, if men start
dominating Me what will happen?

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:26.980
But the man is the, head of the family.

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:34.309
So the woman, should get her authority from
him but she has her own authority, as a mother,

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:36.710
and the husband must respect her.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.849
Otherwise he’ll never be respected.

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:45.580
So it’s kind of mutual understanding between
the two as I have said that, they are the

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.599
two wheels of a chariot, one on the left one
on the right.

00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:55.150
If you change the wheels, then what will happen?

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:58.690
They are absolutely, equal no doubt.

00:53:58.690 --> 00:53:59.880
Absolutely equal.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.630
Only they are not similar, which we must understand
that we are not similar.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:09.270
Is nice to be a woman, I tell you, it’s
much better.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:14.770
Because men have to face so many people, face
so many bosses.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:20.950
You have only one boss, and if you know how
to manage him…

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:28.109
But should be done sweetly, with understanding.

00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:34.240
It works out with your, wisdom.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.490
Must have the wisdom, how to manage it.

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:42.200
But that’s a part of the game, and one has
to play it well.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.480
Not to feel any way dominated by anything,
but it’s a, kind of a framework one has

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.960
to work with.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.260
Now supposing this is on our head.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.299
This is not dominating us, but it has to be
there.

00:54:55.299 --> 00:55:00.300
So a kind of a framework is there, and that
framework is to be accepted.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:08.030
Both of them should accept and the husband
should never make her feel that he is dominating

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.049
her.

00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:15.700
Actually, in India the custom is that husbands
are also very clever, not only the women.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:21.230
So normally they’ll give all the money to
the wife to be managed, and later on take

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.279
away all of that.

00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:26.359
And always they’ll say: ‘All right’.

00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:32.529
They’ll say: ‘All right’, the son to
her, like guru and all that.

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:35.970
Means: ‘You are my lord and this and that
and…’

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.520
That’s how they keep it up.

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.700
Because one thing they must understand is
that if wife is all right the family is all

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.700
right.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.730
If wife is all right your life is all right.

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:48.369
So you must look after your wife.

00:55:48.369 --> 00:55:49.740
Very important.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.390
If you understand that point the men will
never try to dominate.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:56.650
Is a wrong idea is I don’t know from where
it has trickled down that I have said, the

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.450
men should dominate a woman.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:03.619
But false prestige should not be there.

00:56:03.619 --> 00:56:05.990
Like in America we went first.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:10.060
You know American women, how they are.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.311
They’ll divorce ten times, and have all
the money of the men.

00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:15.890
The men are just like beggars and they are
so rich.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.260
It’s a profession with them.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:23.500
The women have this profession of divorcing
men.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.839
So they had cooked and all that.

00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:28.900
So I said: ‘All right let the boys eat first
and then you can eat later on.’

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.029
They said: ‘Mother this is domination.’

00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:32.029
I said: ‘Why?

00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:34.809
Eating first is domination or later on domination.’

00:56:34.809 --> 00:56:39.160
I think eating there, later on is domination,
because you are at peace you see.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.080
Eat as much as you like.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:46.610
But if somebody is eating first, then he’s
in a hurry to finish for the next lot that

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:47.830
has to come up.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:55.339
But if you are the second one then you are
relaxed you are eating the way you like.

00:56:55.339 --> 00:56:56.339
There’s nothing to feed.

00:56:56.339 --> 00:57:02.220
And moreover, it’s an attitude I think that:
‘I love to cook, I love to serve I enjoy

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.220
it.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.220
I enjoy.’

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.220
It’s a, temperament of a woman.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.650
She wants to feed people, she likes it.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:14.599
I tell you, My grandchildren, daughters, both
of them, they were quite small, I asked them

00:57:14.599 --> 00:57:17.170
what do you want to be in life.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.789
So they said: ‘We want to be a nurse or
an airhostess.’

00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:23.539
So I said: ‘Why these two?’

00:57:23.539 --> 00:57:25.854
‘In these only two professions you can give
food to people.

00:57:25.854 --> 00:57:26.854
That’s why.’

00:57:26.854 --> 00:57:30.480
And they play, you know, they play like that.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.960
They’ll make a tray in that they will [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.109
So this is actually innate feeling of a child.

00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:41.930
Like once My daughter told girls, that if
somebody comes from outside you must make

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.770
him sit on the sofa there.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.750
You must see that the fan is open.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:49.760
Give them something to eat, take out from
the fridge and all that.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.110
So one washerman, the dhobi came in.

00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:54.340
They called for [INAUDIBLE] to sit on the
sofa.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.660
Said: ‘I can’t sit.’

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:56.980
‘You have to sit.’

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.300
‘I’m in a hurry.’

00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.460
‘Nothing you have to sit.’

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.220
They made him sit, opened the fan, got everything
from the fridge, put it before him.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.050
‘You have to eat, otherwise we’ll feed,’
you see.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:11.109
And when My daughter entered the house she
saw these girls feeding him with their own

00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:12.109
hands.

00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:13.109
Got such a fright.

00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:15.849
He said: ‘I’m sorry these girls I don’t
know what are they are.’

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:18.463
They said: ‘You told us and we’re very
happy we are doing that.’

00:58:18.463 --> 00:58:24.470
So innately children have this feeling in
their hearts, as girls.

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:29.789
And then when we get a chance we want to do
it.

00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:33.880
I mean, it’s such a pleasure, to feed someone.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:39.869
You must have seen with Indian women, it’s
very common they love to feed others, they’re

00:58:39.869 --> 00:58:41.650
very happy.

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:48.960
And, I mean there’s no domination I mean
if you have to feed someone, that doesn’t

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.950
mean that somebody’s dominating you these
are all nonsensical norms.

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.280
On the contrary it’s a privilege.

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:08.270
Otherwise after sometime we’ll find, that
men will be sitting at home and the women

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:22.420
will be going out.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:56.710
That will be, that’s already a situation
I mean.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:01:12.010
[It’s hot for children I think we are in
a cabin, like the ship I think, without the

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.010
sea.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.010
And there’s no air-conditioning properly.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.010
Outside is better.]

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.010
So, any questions?

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:17.869
[INAUDIBLE something about entrepreneurs and
a book] Entrepreneurs?

01:01:17.869 --> 01:01:18.869
I see.

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:19.869
It’s quite a small book I have to say.

01:01:19.869 --> 01:01:20.869
Yogini: …the entrepreneurs, plastic surgeons,
the cosmetic industry, fashion industry…

01:01:20.869 --> 01:01:21.869
Shri Mataji: So what are they saying?

01:01:21.869 --> 01:01:22.869
Yogini: I think the bottom line is that women
have got very poor, self image through those

01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:23.869
[INAUDIBLE] It’s a multimillion dollar business
[INAUDIBLE] people are forcing women into

01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:24.869
and women are trapped…

01:01:24.869 --> 01:01:25.869
Shri Mataji: So that, and then they’re saying,
so women can’t do this and...

01:01:25.869 --> 01:01:26.869
Yogini:…

01:01:26.869 --> 01:01:27.869
talk about how women are frightened to grow
old, that there is no culture…

01:01:27.869 --> 01:01:28.869
Shri Mataji: You see in, I can have the book?

01:01:28.869 --> 01:01:29.869
In Germany, when I went, there was a lady
and she was telling Me that in Germany, if

01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:30.869
you get old then the men go after younger
girls, because you are left alone.

01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:31.869
Then you have to marry some older man, who
is left by his wife or something.

01:01:31.869 --> 01:01:32.869
It’s a big danger.

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:33.869
I said: ‘Why don’t you produce children.

01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:34.869
I mean they get, if you have four children
they get more money than the Prime Minister.’

01:01:34.869 --> 01:01:36.339
They said: ‘But then you cannot have a husband.’

01:01:36.339 --> 01:01:39.670
Either you have children or you have a husband.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:40.930
It’s like that.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:46.779
It is because, I tell you, it’s very superficial,
very materialistic superficial ideas, about

01:01:46.779 --> 01:01:47.779
women also.

01:01:47.779 --> 01:01:48.869
They’re a commodity.

01:01:48.869 --> 01:01:56.450
In Sahaja Yoga woman, is a person, as equal
as a man, you see.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.500
It’s very different.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:05.369
They are just a commodity to be used, whenever
they want to.

01:02:05.369 --> 01:02:13.080
And I must say also some women know the weaknesses
of men and try to work it out in such a manner.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.290
Sometimes the women only, trouble women, also.

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:22.350
They don’t understand that she’s a woman
and I’m a woman I should not try to trouble.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:30.940
But in sort of competitiveness, they do wrong
things and try to destroy another’s life.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:36.650
But men will have to change now, it’s coming
to that.

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:42.160
All these tricks they have tried and they
are now having, lot of problem.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.990
There are diseases that are coming up.

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:46.670
Already there’s lots of already these secret
diseases there.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:53.349
Apart from these secret diseases there are
diseases which are stopping them, new diseases.

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:55.840
So now they’ll have to come to monogamy.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.609
Once they come to monogamy, then they’ll
have to realize the value of women, what they

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:01.609
are.

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:06.810
And in this all, quarrel about ordination.

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:14.510
Imagine Christianity is so stupid that they
can’t have women for ordination.

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:20.240
Now I am a Woman after all.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:28.400
And now as a reaction, women are so angry,
that a girl came to Me the other day I was

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.420
in Perth she said: ‘Mother, why did you
call God as ‘He’, why don’t you call

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.420
as ‘She’?’

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:39.230
I said: ‘Because I am ‘She’ that’s
why I have to call Him ‘He.’

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.010
But this concept is only, is still there.

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:51.890
In the Indian scriptures nowhere, that there’s
God, and His Power is Adi Shakti.

01:03:51.890 --> 01:04:00.529
But nowhere, even Islam, in Christianity,
in Judaism, in what you call, Buddhism, Jainism,

01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:01.529
nowhere.

01:04:01.529 --> 01:04:08.109
They have not talked of the woman at all.

01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:14.940
As if the whole world is made of men.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.609
And this is surprisingly for developed countries
in Sweden countries like this, they are talking

01:04:17.609 --> 01:04:18.609
this nonsense.

01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:22.000
But the solution is only Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.420
There’s no other solution.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:36.280
Even women go and fight with men what’s
the use?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.650
Men fight with women no use.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:43.280
So the best thing for them is to get to Sahaja
Yoga to understand the value of women.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:51.569
They understand what they are for, and what
is our relationship means you see.

01:04:51.569 --> 01:04:54.539
It’s such an enjoyment.

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:57.540
Stupid those people who do not want to have
that enjoyment.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:03.039
Also your media is responsible whenever you
open the television you just find husband

01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:05.269
wife fighting …It’s too much.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:10.000
All the time fighting, fighting, they show…they
never show good relationship.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.440
Once I asked Derek Lee: ‘Is there any novel
where they show the romance of husband and

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440
wife?’

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.670
He said: ‘There’s no book’.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.819
No book in English.

01:05:19.819 --> 01:05:22.500
The whole of English language there’s no
romance of husband and wife, can you imagine.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.059
I mean that is how you get into tragedies.

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:32.859
But in India if you see, the literature has
certain ethics.

01:05:32.859 --> 01:05:36.759
One of them is only the romance between husband
and wife is a romance.

01:05:36.759 --> 01:05:39.279
The rest of it is, vulgarity.

01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:52.280
This is the concept it shows.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:58.289
Also because mostly they are arranged marriages,
so they don’t know all this romanticism

01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:59.329
before marriage.

01:05:59.329 --> 01:06:08.000
So they are waiting for their wife and whole
thing, and the wife becomes everything to

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
the husband, and same, vice versa.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.059
So the whole cultural concept has changed.

01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:16.960
It used to be the same way before, in every
country, but now we are advanced you see.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:24.220
In that advancement we have done this kind
of a thing, is to make antagonistic societies

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.650
of men and women.

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:27.700
It’s very sad.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:31.109
But we are very superficial.

01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:34.950
But the concept itself is wrong.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:44.890
I think the basic fundamental thing, in the
western culture is, to see and to be seen.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:47.510
This is what I’ve realized.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.079
That’s the culture.

01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:53.290
That people should see you, and you should
be able to see others.

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.490
I mean, it is so superficial.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:07:01.539
Now they see somebody’s legs and somebody’s
knees, I mean, what’s the use of a joyless

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:02.539
pursuit.

01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:03.539
That person doesn’t belong to you nothing
of the kind.

01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:04.539
What’s the use of seeing these things?

01:07:04.539 --> 01:07:07.259
But this, we have become very superficial.

01:07:07.259 --> 01:07:13.290
And it’s going on and on.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:22.099
But I think this will all stop in Sahaja Yoga,
gradually we’ll start seeing the beauty

01:07:22.099 --> 01:07:23.150
inside.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:28.369
You know Chris Marlow you know from London.

01:07:28.369 --> 01:07:31.289
He had a wife Jane.

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:34.009
She was quite a dry person.

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:40.580
She herself was saying that: ‘Mother I am
no good for him.’

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580
So they divorced.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.760
Then he told Me: ‘Mother I want to marry
a girl who has lots of vibrations.’

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.310
I said: ‘What about looks?’

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:48.170
‘No I don’t see any looks.

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.700
I want to see a girl with vibrations.’

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.650
And we had a girl from Amalhabad.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.390
Very dark, extremely dark, and village-like,
absolutely.

01:07:55.390 --> 01:08:02.940
You will never, I mean, I don’t think from
your standards she may not be beautiful from

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.740
My standards she was very good.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.740
Full of vibrations.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740
Full of vibrations.

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.509
As soon as she came on the stage he jumped,
said: ‘This is the one.’

01:08:10.509 --> 01:08:15.559
He’s so tall, she’s short and [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.650
And he looks after her so well I tell you.

01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:24.510
And then he went to her place, her village,
all the way to Amalhabad.

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:26.230
My sister saw, she said: ‘What a couple.’

01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:29.760
I said: ‘The couple has chosen each other,
I can’t help it.’

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.300
He’s so fond of her, he looks after her.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.410
She’s very sweet, I mean I really love with
that.

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:43.450
But I didn’t know that this fellow will
have the same sort of a feeling.

01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:53.650
Because we are superficial these things are
accepred.

01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:57.060
You should see the inner being.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.270
How beautiful it is.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:10.210
Look at that Elizabeth Taylor, that stupid
country of America.

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:13.110
This was her eighth divorce, I mean eighth
honeymoon.

01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:18.830
So they had three thousand or four thousand
people just standing outside her house to

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.550
see, she is going for her honeymoon.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.100
Can you imagine stupid.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.840
And there were ten helicopters hovering round.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:38.000
And they were parachuting, and some of them
fell on the trees and some fell on the people

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
who were there.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.350
And they were quite excited, very sensational.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:45.160
You know such stupid people these Americans
are.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.440
I don’t know what to say.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.580
And this lady had divorced eight.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:10:00.220
And this husband of hers, this one, he’s
I think, I don’t know how many years younger

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.600
to her, like her son.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.600
And also he’s an ordinary man or something.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.140
But just for the heck of it.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:09.740
She has no sense of marriage, nothing.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:17.360
But what she has done is she’s operated
her eyelids and she’s put her up and all

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.020
that, and she looks younger now and she says:
‘I can…’

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.650
There’s no, in that country you cannot mature.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.650
So stupid.

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:29.570
I mean, I was yet to come across people in
a group so stupid as that.

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.800
Stupidest people you see.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800
Stupidest.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:38.280
You can never mature this way.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.840
Still Sahaja Yoga is now working.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.690
Gregoire feels so exhausted.

01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:54.800
Every time he footsoaks he just lies flat,
saying: ‘Mother, please save me from New

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.800
York.’

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.800
It’s terrible.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.880
There’s no way of maturity.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.080
[INAUDIBLE] They invited me for this Jungian
Society.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.080
And I went there.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.370
Of course I didn’t read Jung much but that
day I got hold of a book and I found out the

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:11.570
reason why Indians have failed.

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:17.840
So I talked to them they were very much impressed
and all that.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.890
Then the president of that society is eighty
years of age, and he said that: ‘Mother

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:23.380
I must see You I have some private thing to
talk.’

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.380
I said: ‘All right.’

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.380
This old man came about eighty years of age.

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.380
He said: ‘I have a very serious problem.’

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.480
I said: ‘What’s the serious problem.’

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.380
He says: ‘You see I had a keep.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:40.330
Because I am a Catholic I could not marry
the keep but I never told my wife.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.910
[INAUDIBLE] I never told my wife.’

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:50.410
‘So now what am I supposed to do ?’ He
said: ‘Now that my wife is dead and I want

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:51.820
that keep to stay with me but she has refused.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:58.410
Can you do something to see that the keep
stays with me.’

01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:01.440
I said: ‘It’s all right.’

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440
Eighty year-old man.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.900
I was turning sixty by that time.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.650
An eighty year-old man talking like this to
Me.

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:11.930
I said: ‘Now what is happening to this man?’

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:21.820
And he is the chairman of the Jungian Society,
International.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.100
See the maturity of that person.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.550
Eighty year-old.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:32.730
In America, such cases so much.

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:35.660
Terrible.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:40.350
Extremely stupid and I don’t know, they
have no confidence in themselves.

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:42.950
All the time they think we should not get
old.

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:49.720
So there was, on the television they showed
the cinema actors and actresses coming for

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.600
a dance of ‘shake’ and they were all about
ninety years of age.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.570
Then when they got down from the car only
they were shaking.

01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:57.570
I said: ‘What’s the use, of going to shake?’

01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.630
In ninety years they have not grown.

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:05.390
Funny dresses they were wearing and all that.

01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:08.030
So when are they going to grow.

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:09.470
There’s no maturity.

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:20.720
The atmosphere is the other way round I think.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.800
Very stupid.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.880
Really mad.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.600
But people start copying them.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.110
Whatever they say people listen to them even
English I’m surprised.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.710
I said that: ‘You are sensible people.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.840
Why do you follow these stupid Americans,
or the French?’

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.040
English people are rather mature.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.470
Maybe they lived in India so they have matured
quickly I don’t know why.

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:48.290
But compared with these stupid people they
are much more mature.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:51.350
And now they are following the American style.

01:13:51.350 --> 01:14:01.810
They used to follow first the French style,
now the American style.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:02.810
They don’t stand on their own legs.

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:03.890
But Italians have a good sense of ridicule.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:08.350
They understand what is ridiculous, that’s
something about them.

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:12.060
A great sense of ridiculous.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:19.900
It will all change in Sahaja Yoga it will.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:23.180
You are in the Kingdom of God.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.330
You shouldn’t worry about these things.

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:32.380
But what to do, if they join us they can come
up.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:46.020
But they don’t want to, let them be like
as they are.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.500
What else?

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.440
Yogini:…lymphatic system…

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.330
Shri Mataji: Lymphatic system?

01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:12.520
If the lymphatic system is under attack you
may be left-sided.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:21.670
You see it is, on the whole, there are only
two types of problems actually.

01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:25.440
Third type doesn’t exist, or doesn’t bother
us.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.310
One is the left another is the right, you
see.

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:33.110
Now the lymphatic system is actually, the
combination of both.

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:34.670
It’s a psychosomatic disease.

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:37.760
For that you have to do just three-candle
treatment.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.810
You see it is reduced to such a simple thing
either you do three-candle treatment, or you

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:46.480
do water treatment.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:57.150
The third type is the one where you have been
to wrong gurus, in the center.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:16:00.200
If I run some wrong type of meditation [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.360
For that also it’s three-candle treatment,
mostly.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.940
Or maybe if the [INAUDIBLE] comes there’s
a little change also sometimes.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.890
But whatever it is, this is very simple for
physical.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:16.970
Anybody has lymphatic system problem has to
do left side first.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:17.970
So this is psychosomatic.

01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:23.000
First you must get rid of the psycho side,
so do the left side.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.810
When it is cleared out, then right side is
not difficult.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:34.620
If you are too right-sided, then what happens,
it’s like a pendulum, you move from right

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.850
to left.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.600
Then psychosomatic troubles start.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.240
The best is first to remove the left, then
is look after the right.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:48.310
Sahaja Yoga is a very simple way of clearing.

01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:50.450
It works.

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:56.990
Somebody should help you in left side is to
give you bandhan on your chakras with a candle.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:17:08.300
Put a candle on one side of the left swadisthana
and also one before the Photograph.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.460
Because it’s all due to viruses.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.940
And the viruses are there because your attention
in the left.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:19.650
Once your attention goes away from there you
are rid of that.

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.060
All right?

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.180
It’s not complicated.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.710
Sahaja Yoga is very simple.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:32.980
You know we have cured people who were about
to go on the dialysis.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.200
Kidney has been cured.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.200
Can you imagine?

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.090
Of course [INAUDIBLE] blood cancer that has
been cured no doubt.

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:54.610
But imagine the kidney, people were going
on the dialysis.

01:17:54.610 --> 01:18:00.160
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] Of course.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.610
I mean, we make the human beings.

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:11.850
[INAUDIBLE] You first, if you are evolving,
you are also evolving human beings with you.

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:18.560
So it’s for the emancipation of the whole
world.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.450
It’s not only your evolution.

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.640
No no not at all.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.650
That was over.

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:33.430
Now I have told about that in [INAUDIBLE],
is that, from Buddha’s future they say there

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:37.960
will be a future Buddha who will be Maitreya.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.140
Maitreya means Three Mothers together, will
be the future Buddha.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:45.010
And that is called as Bodhisattva.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:50.440
Now the Bodhisattva is the One, who will become
Buddha, means who will get Enlightened right,

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.650
and will work for the other people.

01:18:52.650 --> 01:19:00.100
So is already described, and you don’t have
to suffer, you don’t have to do anything

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:05.000
as it was before individually, but now you’ll
work with the collective.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.640
So, you have to work with the collective otherwise
you have no meaning.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.160
Also you cannot be cleansed unless and until
you come to collective.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.230
If you say: ‘I’m staying at home and I’m
doing all the puja and all that,’ doesn’t

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:21.230
work out.

01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:30.910
Like a nail if it is cut, it doesn’t grow.

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.220
Very simple.

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:41.810
It’s not for one person no doubt.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.550
I mean how can it be, for one.

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:47.060
Because the time has come for doing collective
work now.

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:55.920
The whole world has to change.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:10.930
Yogi: Shri Mother, will we ever be able to
go to Tasmania?

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:14.610
Shri Mataji: [HINDI] That’s [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:18.300
Yes they have to come.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.590
They have to come here.

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:24.770
Like you see, Sicily, we are now having lots
of Sahaja Yogis there.

01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:25.770
They all came down.

01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:27.340
Then I can now go to Sicily.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.850
We have very great people in Tasmania.

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:33.150
Now that’s the point.

01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:36.630
So when they will come and they’ll get their
Realization then I can go.

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:48.600
You see, if I go to a place it is like the,
should I say, the seeds being sprouted nobody

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.520
to look after.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:21:00.830
Yogi: There were quite a number of people
who came from Tasmania.

01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:04.260
I think some of them wonder if they could
ever go back.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.260
Shri Mataji: They should.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.260
They should.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.260
They should go with their bandhans and try
to save their country.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.260
They should.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:09.260
If they go and establish it I’ll definitely
go.

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:12.350
It’s quite a remarkable place that Tasmania
is.

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.710
Talismad means, all these secret, magic.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:21.150
From that Tasmania word must have come.

01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:29.330
Yogi: How many Tasmanians are there here?

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:38.680
Shri Mataji: Still very few, to fight those
negativities there.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.380
Very negative.

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.790
Very negative, isn’t it.

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:48.050
That’s like, we have Calcutta.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:52.310
Too much of black magic.

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:54.010
Too much.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:57.440
But gradually we have now, got it out.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440
It’s changed.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.790
One side is they are all full of black magic,
those who believe in God.

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:02.790
The another side are communists.

01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:03.850
But still now we have thousands.

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:04.850
It is remarkable.

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:16.540
But people had to work very hard for it, very
hard.

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:25.040
So many people went from Nagpur, from Bombay,
from Delhi to help them.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:31.850
Still some places I’ve not been, like Ceylon,
Assam.

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:34.181
We have some coming from there.

01:22:34.181 --> 01:22:35.181
I told them next year I’ll try to be there.

01:22:35.181 --> 01:22:36.181
Yogi: Shri Mataji, …Photograph where Hands
are like that.

01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:39.480
Can you tell us the significance of that please?

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:56.380
Shri Mataji: Hands like that.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:02.140
You want to know what’s the symbol?

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.080
This is for assurance.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.640
See this is for assurance.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.290
It has powers.

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:11.040
This Hand has tremendous powers.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.560
And this One is for giving.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.560
You see.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.050
So these are two aspects.

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:26.770
But actually as you know this is the, power
of action.

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:27.960
So it acts.

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.310
And this is the power of desire.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:48.440
So this is the Love that’s flowing of your
Mother, and this is how She [INAUDIBLE] it.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:24:11.310
But now I have given up.

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:30.020
I used to do it in the beginning it was needed,
but now it’s not necessary.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:43.380
It works even without that.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:25:04.550
They are called as mudras which I used in
the beginning.

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:21.429
Now I don’t use that, mostly.

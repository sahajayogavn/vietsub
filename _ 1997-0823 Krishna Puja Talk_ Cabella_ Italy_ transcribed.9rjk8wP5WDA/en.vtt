Shri KRISHNA PUJA
Primordial Taboos and Sahaj Dharma

00:03:38.810 --> 00:04:24.840
August 23, 1997 – CABELLA, Italy

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:52.450
Lecture starts here:

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:07.900
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna Puja.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:18.289
I went to America and they wanted Me to have
a Mahakali Puja.

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.800
But I said, “No, let Me talk about Krishna
only.”

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:37.949
Because we have to first realize what is the
strength of this Puja, how are we going to

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.449
establish Shri Krishna within ourselves.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.800
He Himself has said that “Whenever there
is a downfall of dharma.”

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.419
Dharma doesn’t mean what we understand as
Hinduism, Christianity or Islamic nonsense

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.400
- it is not.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:13.219
Dharma means our primordial taboos that are
built-in, in the human beings.

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.830
About these, I think aboriginals knew better
than we.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:27.219
But then what we did, we dominated them and
also they had to change their style of life.

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:37.430
The primordial taboos are only understood
if people are trying to understand oneself

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.889
or else whatever has come to them through
tradition.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:54.539
Now, sahaj dharma is little bit different
in the sense that it’s much higher than

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:04.729
the sahaj ideas that we talk of, but it’s
much higher than even what Shri Krishna said

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.379
or Shri Rama said.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.949
First, Shri Rama thought, best is to give
them disciplines.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:22.569
People should be serious about life, have
full idea about their own being, they should

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:24.280
respect themselves.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.240
All these things were written down long time
back.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:38.180
Also, people, basically when they were good
people, they understood that whatever is bad

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.050
for us, we should not do.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.219
These are primordial taboos.

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:49.629
Now, these primordial taboos are built in
within us.

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:54.389
Now, supposing I say, “Don’t drink.”

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.659
You will go and drink.

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:02.000
If I say, “Don’t tell lies,” you will
tell lies.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.430
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo, because they think

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.870
now they have freedom, freedom to do what
they like.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.130
You are free people.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.460
Actually they are not.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:27.960
They are under the spell of all the kinds
of allurement, you can call it, or temptations

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.949
which are against human life.

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:39.200
And it’s very natural to be a person of
dharma.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.330
Small children mostly have it.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.530
For example, I’ve seen children, they feel
very shy to take out their clothes - even

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.190
small, small boys, I’ve seen.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:58.560
They won’t take out their clothes in the
presence of others; they feel shy.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.330
So, all these are described like, Ya Devi,
Sarva Butheshu, Lajja Rupena Samsthita.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:16.340
So, you should be shy; you should be humble
and respect your body, it’s very important

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.980
in these modern times.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.150
Exposure of body is regarded as a great achievement
of women.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.370
They are trying to become aboriginals, you
see.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.100
That time they never had these ideas and they
were not so confused, you see.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:37.220
So, even if their women were scantily dressed,
it didn’t mean that it was some sort of

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:50.470
a sex or some sort of an attraction for men,
or men behaving in funny manners to show that

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.040
they have a special attraction for women.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.470
I mean, why should you?

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:06.080
It is absolutely absurd that men should be
attracted to women and women should be attracted

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:13.020
to men - and on the road, on the street, you
go, you see, just that going on!

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.910
This adharma is the worst I think, for it’s
a curse.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.400
Because after coming to Sahaja Yoga also people
start doing this nonsense, you know.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.120
They should all go to lunatic asylum, I think,
they are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.140
But dharma gets established as soon as you
have the light of the spirit.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:47.870
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put down
A, B, C, D, E, F. At the time of Moses, also

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.060
He had to put down Ten Commandments.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:11:05.600
But Krishna thought the other way round - to
establish a dharma of pure love - pure love.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:14.780
So, because He wanted that Shri Rama’s taboos
were forced on people, just like Islamic,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.010
just like Christians - never works.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:24.710
So, He thought better to ask them in their
freedom, they must develop pure love.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:31.090
Radha, who was with Him as His power, is called
as Alladhadayini.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:37.550
She’s the one who gives joy - pure joy!

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:46.110
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.060
Now, drinking is against you, you know that.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:56.760
Today they are talking about tobacco, tomorrow
they’ll talk of drinking when they will

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.860
find so many people suffering from horrible
livers and dying.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.810
Then they will taboo it.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.800
But it’s a natural taboo for your body.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.570
If you do something all the time which is
not good for you, for your good life, you

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.540
are becoming adharma.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:36.620
This is to be understood very clearly that
the sahaja dharma is that you are just free

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.330
- complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.530
You’re above it.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.990
You’re above.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:54.180
This sahaj dharma is above the dharma established
by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama, because you

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.520
have reached that stage.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.630
Is in complete freedom you have to be dharmic.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.920
Whatever is not good for you, you should not
do.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:13.250
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t
do this or you don’t do that.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:20.090
Whatever I say may not be acceptable, but
immediately your vibrations will tell you.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.240
This is sahaj dharma.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:34.420
In the sahaj dharma you get rid of all kinds
of, as they say: kaama, krodha, mada, matsa,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.280
lobha, moha.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.840
Means: lust, anger, attractions, then greed.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.920
Greed - that’s very important, greed.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.970
Greed.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.090
And attractions.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:08.950
Now, if you understand how people are greedy,
greedy for what?

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:14.190
This America is dying of consumerism, you
see.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.870
Now, see the trick of the trade.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:24.550
In America, you can borrow any amount of money
from the bank, no problem.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:32.440
Now, even if you don’t borrow, they’ll
send you a letter, “Why don’t you take

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.710
twenty thousand checks we are sending you,
why not have it?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:44.840
Ah, very rich you’ll become, you see – it’s
very nice to take the loan.”

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.190
I was told some people used to come to Ganapatipule
after taking loans.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.000
I said, “Stop that nonsense!”

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.660
So they take the loan and then they come to
Ganapatipule.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:04.520
All the time their mind is: ‘How will I
pay this loan, how will I manage?’

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.620
All the time the attention is distracted,
even when you want to do something good to

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.980
yourself of coming to Ganapatipule.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.860
So, such a mind is not free.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:29.400
The free mind is that which has attention
completely enlightened by the spirit.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:43.270
But problem is we are still rising out of
this human bondage to a higher life of realization.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:53.130
And when we are going to that level, we have
to realize that we have to give up all these

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:59.180
shackles, all these horrible things within
us.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:08.370
Like a bird, when it is born out of the egg,
shakes out all the parts of the egg.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:13.270
Your brothers, your sisters, your father,
your mother, your husband.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:19.050
Everybody - they try to put you down.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.800
Now, if they are drinking, they’ll say,
“Come along, you better have something to

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.340
drink, you are not social, you are useless,
you are not up to date.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.550
What is this nonsense?”

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:41.000
That’s how a fashion starts and this collective
action of fashion didn’t come from Shri

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.760
Krishna and not in Sahaj.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.320
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:56.260
If you want, you can wear a good dress, if
you don’t want you need not.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.460
You are free.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.160
You are free from money bondage.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.890
This is very important.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.120
Money bondage is another thing.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.230
I know some Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja
Yoga trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.429
You came to Sahaja Yoga for what?

00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:17.630
To get out of that money bondage.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.689
In the sahaj dharma, to you money is nothing
but the dust of your feet.

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:25.999
Nothing so important.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:34.919
Then, we have such a collective sense of accepting
nonsense.

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:38.570
That has to be dropped out, specially in America,
I was surprised.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.080
Also in England.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:48.590
A fellow came as a hippie.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:57.909
His hair were looking like some monkey.

00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:59.549
Monkey is better I must say.

00:17:59.549 --> 00:18:07.580
I don’t know like what, all put together
like a, you can say - there is nothing to

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.420
compare, I tell you.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.750
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.249
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.

00:18:16.249 --> 00:18:19.899
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:24.389
I said, “But your brain is modern, what’s
the use of growing your hair like that?

00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:26.210
You think you can become primitive?

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.260
You cannot!”

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.159
Then afterwards I learned that he died.

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:43.260
Another one like that came and he didn’t
die, but went to lunatic asylum.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.279
Like that I met many, but why do you do it?

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:50.340
Because that’s the fashion.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:58.740
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.980
Now there is a joke about the n HYPERLINK
"http://www.nouveauriche.com/" ouveau riche

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.249
people, in Russia especially.

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:09.610
Russians are not like that, normally.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:15.140
They don’t accept something because it’s
a fashion.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:24.990
So, one fellow said that “My God you lost
your hand in that accident!”

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:31.070
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very expensive
watch from Switzerland.”

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.070
“Really?

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.070
What?”

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.679
“It was a Rolex.”

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:40.110
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:46.620
The Rolex is gone - Rolex is the fashion.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.690
So these are n HYPERLINK "http://www.nouveauriche.com/"
ouveau riche people who have money.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.120
(Dog is on the stage)

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.130
Come along.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.129
Come along.

00:19:58.129 --> 00:20:00.129
Sit down.

00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:02.139
Sit down.

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:05.139
Now, go down.

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:14.159
They (the dogs) don’t form any fashions,
I have not seen dogs taken to any fashions.

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:21.809
Monkeys taking, I mean, supposing, you see
the Italian designers make something special

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:25.309
for them, they won’t think much of it.

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:30.740
Maybe their masters might buy, but not these
animals.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:37.820
Now, we don’t have to become animals of
course, but we don’t also have to become

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.150
slaves of fashions.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.440
So there are some shops which are very expensive.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440
Why?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.210
Because they are designers.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.360
So you move about telling everybody, “See,
I am wearing this thing from a designer shop,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.580
this is from designer shop.”

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.860
That means, what about you?

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:04.490
You have no sense of designs; you have no
sense of understanding what you need and what

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.659
you don’t need.

00:21:05.659 --> 00:21:12.460
And nowadays most of them are in jail also,
sorry to say, but they have money and they

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.740
have made money by befooling you.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:22.840
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things which

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.999
were coming from Italy - designs, Italian
designs, written that Italian design so they

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:32.230
were buying it, Italian design.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:42.419
I was surprised that such artistic things
they create that are available everywhere,

00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:44.600
such beautiful things.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:54.529
But what they believe in is some sort of a
group madness, everybody wearing the same

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:57.970
kind of design is from this or that.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.190
This is not sahaj dharma.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.249
You are not slaves of anything.

00:22:01.249 --> 00:22:02.600
You are free people.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.220
You have not to accept any design or anything.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.860
Ah, it is there, is there!

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.389
Let the stupid follow that.

00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:12.279
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:19.019
Now, this also prevails among people who are
supposed to be sadhus, they all dress up the

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:21.970
same way.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.600
How can you make out who is who?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:30.210
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress
up the same way, look the same way, cut your

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.869
hair the same way.

00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:32.869
No.

00:22:32.869 --> 00:22:38.889
You have to be individuals, because you are
free, but that doesn’t mean - freedom is

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:46.970
always supported by wisdom - that doesn’t
mean that you do what you like.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:55.139
All kinds of funny things happen when a person
doesn’t know what is the light of the spirit.

00:22:55.139 --> 00:23:02.010
In the light of the spirit, you don’t get
involved into this kind of collective madness

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.490
that is going on.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.860
We are so collective in mad things.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.379
I wish they could be collective more in wise
things.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:19.899
Wisdom is very important, and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji - alladhadayini shakti

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:22.929
- has to come within us.

00:23:22.929 --> 00:23:31.360
Means, when we meet another person in the
collectivity, another person should feel happy

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.549
with you.

00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:37.870
So He taught the dharma of love.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:46.309
Love is not there if you discard because he
is black or because he is brown, because he

00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:48.049
is white.

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:54.720
It’s very superficial - what is black, white
and yellow?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.970
I don’t understand.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:03.331
Here they go to the sea shores to make themselves
black and there they say, “we don’t want

00:24:03.331 --> 00:24:09.809
to have any blacks,” specially for Americans.

00:24:09.809 --> 00:24:18.549
I think this kind of separation I found there,
among the blacks and the whites, I really

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:19.549
wept.

00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:21.139
I went to Harlem.

00:24:21.139 --> 00:24:24.919
Sahaja yogis said, “Mother will you go to
Harlem?”

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:27.029
I said, “Why not, I’m black.

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:28.900
If you call Me black, I’m black.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.980
If you call Me white, I’m white.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.500
If you call Me yellow, I’m yellow, so I’m
going.”

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.700
And there I had a lecture, you know, so many
people were there, really I cannot forget.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:49.549
It is one of the most famous place that there
is built in that hall and the same hall is

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:57.019
built in Australia where I had addressed many
people.

00:24:57.019 --> 00:24:58.820
I thought, just look at this!

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.509
They said, “Mother, the Australians copied
from us.”

00:25:02.509 --> 00:25:06.159
Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,
I tell you.

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:12.749
I could see their heart, I could feel it and
the fellow was trying to compare, after My

00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:15.309
lecture he just came, he hugged Me, kissed
Me.

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:21.009
I mean, he would have even minced Me, little
boy about twenty-two years of age - such love

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:22.009
he felt.

00:25:22.009 --> 00:25:27.659
And he said, “Mother, next time You come,
You are going to come to Harlem.”

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:31.259
But I am told that hall is closed.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:41.989
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy, not only against democracy

00:25:41.989 --> 00:25:45.889
but against what Abraham Lincoln wanted.

00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:56.600
They had such a great man there and there
is a little street I saw in his name.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:05.419
Of course in Washington they say they have
some nice, beautiful statues.

00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:16.659
But otherwise his principles are finished;
his ideals are finished because somehow or

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:26.259
other, some people came and wrote against
- England especially - against the black people.

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:33.429
What business they have to write against something
that is created by God?

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:40.289
If there are the same colors everywhere, they
all will look like military people.

00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:44.450
They have to have different colors; they have
to have different hues.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.029
See, look at the trees; look at the flowers.

00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:56.669
Look at the different hues the sky has, just
to make us happy – alladha.

00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:59.659
What gives you happiness is variety.

00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:04.419
Variety is a sign of beauty.

00:27:04.419 --> 00:27:09.739
If there is no variety, it’s so boring I
tell you, so very boring.

00:27:09.739 --> 00:27:14.399
But they are very proud of it and they think
no end of themselves.

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:20.710
They think they are very great people; they
have a sense of superiority, because they

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:29.049
have a certain type of nose or maybe certain
type of lips or maybe certain types of hair.

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:32.950
Such stupid things they are and you join hands
with them?

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.989
How can you join hands with them?

00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:36.109
You want your freedom?

00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:38.879
Then be a free person.

00:27:38.879 --> 00:27:45.049
In the freedom you have to have variety, very
important.

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:52.120
I would say that now the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America should have a new

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.809
style of drive; go to the black people.

00:27:55.809 --> 00:28:05.940
I was very happy to see the South American
seminar that they had taken specially to aboriginal

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.940
people.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.259
They went and met them.

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:14.799
I have met them also and I was so surprised
that they immediately said, “Mother, You

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:19.720
are spiritual, we know, but can You solve
our problem?”

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.990
I said, “What’s your problem?”

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:27.230
“Very simple, we have a land – all right,
then - very little land, five, six acres of

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:32.590
land that belongs to us where the sage grows.”

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.259
Sage is a kind of a, according to them, is
a holy plant.

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.259
All right.

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:45.309
“Now, we always meet, all of us, there for
different festivals because we regard that

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:46.690
land as a holy land.”

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.039
They know so many things, you know.

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:53.619
This is a holy land; there were vibrations
for that.

00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:56.690
So they always used to meet, so natural.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.690
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:06.049
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:08.320
I said, “To an Indian?”

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.975
“Yes, so can you request this Indian to
return it to us, we’ll pay him the money.”

00:29:12.975 --> 00:29:14.590
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.289
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:19.749
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi!

00:29:19.749 --> 00:29:25.019
He won’t leave you even one single pai,
is he going to give you this?

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:31.519
I’m sorry, I may be divine or I may be anything,
I can’t help you.”

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:35.149
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it.

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:37.169
They should have raised voice.

00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:39.600
They should have told the government, “Please
return their land.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.440
Why do you want to have it?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.649
Why want to grab it?”

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:46.570
As it is all the Americans are immigrants.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:55.539
They don’t belong to that place, that they
were not owners of that place, that ground

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:57.679
- they are immigrants.

00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:02.029
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that and then to think they are

00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:03.029
superior.

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:07.529
It’s very nice, somebody enters your house
and thinks he is very superior and drives

00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:11.029
out all the people of the family.

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:15.890
That is what has happened in America and just
opposite is sahaj dharma.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:25.489
With sahaj dharma, you take people into your
heart, you love them.

00:30:25.489 --> 00:30:30.400
Your love flows all the time; your compassion
flows all the time.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.460
To Me it’s a problem, this body is more
compassionate than Myself.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.340
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:45.929
It wants to solve the problem of others, but
I don’t think you can have that kind of

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:47.539
a body, you shouldn’t have.

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:52.239
But, at least you should have a heart which
is open.

00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:55.090
You see on the street somebody who is a dark
fellow.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:08.049
I like about the black Americans that once
I got down in one airport, so one gentleman,

00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:10.899
black gentleman, “Hello darling, how are
You?

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:12.139
How are You here?

00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.000
Very happy to see You!”

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.720
“I’m happy to see you.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.409
How are you?”

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:24.669
Then once I was traveling in - what was the
airport?

00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:25.720
Ursula was with Me.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:31.769
So he looked at Me, one fellow, very tall,
hefty, fat, you know.

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:34.779
He said, “Ah!

00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:35.779
Are You back again?”

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:39.049
I said, “I’m back.

00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:40.989
You know Me?”

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:45.090
“Of course, of course, I know you.”

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.950
He had never met Me, I had never known him.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.169
But I felt happy, I felt very happy.

00:31:53.169 --> 00:31:55.830
That’s the best way to meet people.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:00.499
Supposing you are walking on the street, you
see some black gentleman going.

00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:04.950
It’s a terrible life there, I tell you;
it’s a terrible life for them.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:10.009
I’ve known, I’ve read books on them, I’ve
cried and wept and I felt very sorry.

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:15.749
So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should just jump
at them and you should say, “Hello, how

00:32:15.749 --> 00:32:17.919
are you?”

00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:18.919
Shake hands with them.

00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:24.230
They won’t cut your throat, I can tell you
this.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:29.769
In criminality, I don’t know who is more
criminal in America, whether they are the

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:31.789
blacks or the whites, competing.

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:37.919
But, if you are kind and if you are loving,
you can remove that part of criminality which

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:43.119
is within them because hatred can be only
washed away by pure love.

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:53.620
But people think they are very cunning, very
superior - in cunningness, of course.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.009
Otherwise, what is their superiority?

00:32:56.009 --> 00:33:00.499
Only this complexion, this white complexion
is the worst of all.

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:07.249
I was very fair, very fair, till I got married,
or for some time, and then I started becoming

00:33:07.249 --> 00:33:09.609
darker and darker.

00:33:09.609 --> 00:33:15.299
Because white complexion gets all kinds of,
see, the light you put on Me, I absorb, I

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:16.679
get a black spot.

00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:20.739
So it’s not a very great thing to be white,
I don’t think so.

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:23.690
It looks very funny and pale and joyless.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:33.539
But no use going to the sea, making your body,
I think brown - brown, not so black, brown

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:40.200
and then suffering from cancer of the skin.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.230
This kind of stupidity is also very much fashionable.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:54.090
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get impressed
by these we should be on the watch.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.850
I saw My granddaughter was wearing a sleeveless
dress.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.070
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.020
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very
hot.”

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.020
She’s young.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.980
I said, “But see, these are two very important
chakras.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.830
If you expose them, then you’ll have problem.”

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:20.000
She doesn’t like to wear dresses which are
above the knee, but she says people wear even

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
above the knee.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.859
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them clothed, otherwise

00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:32.169
if they are affected, we’ll have knee trouble.”

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:33.740
Immediately she changed, immediately.

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:39.169
“Mother, I’ll wear blouse from inside
and something from outside.”

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:40.369
Immediately.

00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:51.210
Because she knew this is a natural primordial
taboo that we should not expose ours - these

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.230
two chakras and these chakras.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:35:04.280
But, nowadays, the more you have long legs,
I don’t know, they have shorter clothes.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:14.410
And I don’t understand what is in the legs,
the whole beauty is in the legs or what?

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:19.640
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with
Me.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.930
She was wearing a burqa because she was a
Muslim.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:29.039
And by the time we landed in London, she took
out the burqa and the dress was much above

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:30.039
the knees.

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:34.280
I said, “What kind of Muslim woman is she?

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:40.960
She’s worse than even Christians because
they wouldn’t wear such a thing, you know,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.789
to come out of the aeroplane, you have to
come down on the staircase.”

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:53.869
No lajja, no shame, nothing, shamelessness!

00:35:53.869 --> 00:36:01.079
So, sahaj dharma is that you have shame, you
have sense of shame.

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:06.240
What you talk to others, what you say to others,
how you behave towards them, in the sahaj

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.770
dharma is alladhadayini.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.799
If something is not alladhadayini, keep quiet.

00:36:12.799 --> 00:36:13.799
Don’t say.

00:36:13.799 --> 00:36:18.540
What is the need?

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.760
What is there to be sarcastic?

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.079
Showing off your brains in your sarcasm.

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:36.720
It’s not a sign of good breeding that you
talk sarcastically to others in a sharp way.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.660
But if you talk sweetly, what’s the harm?

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.750
This sweetness comes from Radhaji.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:52.400
Now, of course they have misused Her and made
Her into a sort of a Romeo-Juliet business.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.390
It was not that.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.069
She was a very pure woman and She was Mahalakshmi.

00:36:59.069 --> 00:37:09.329
So, to be a Mahalaksmi, after coming to Sahaja
Yoga, you should know that you should dress

00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:14.390
up in a way that’s perfectly all right.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:23.470
Once I remember, I was in a big party and
one gentleman came and he sat down, “Aaaaaah!”

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.150
I said, “What happened?”

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:32.180
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.200
See these women, I’m fed up.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.480
But You came, I felt such a relief.”

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.820
I said, “What is so relieving?”

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.410
“You are so serene.”

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.790
So, women are serene in sahaj dharma.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:56.740
They are not stupid, frivolous, laughing at
anything.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.490
That’s not the way for a woman.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.950
Anything happens, they must laugh.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:08.740
I mean, there is something laughable, all
right, but some things are not even laughable,

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740
they'll laugh.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.160
That’s not the way.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.220
That can be ridiculous also, can ridicule
others.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:28.060
But laugh of appreciation, laugh of enjoyment,
is so pure and creates such beautiful atmosphere.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:35.589
I think the whole ecological problem is in
our brains – [Hindi words].

00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:38.510
It is not outside.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.920
It is inside us, which is reflected outside.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:49.500
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:58.579
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts to our behavior, to how we live.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:04.599
In the sahaj dharma, you give up lust and
greed very easily, that I know.

00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:10.250
I mean if they can’t even give up that,
then they should not call themselves Sahaja

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.250
yogis.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.089
The first thing you give up is lust and greed.

00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:23.640
I find it among young people now, that those
who come to Sahaja Yoga become really very

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.520
free people.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.230
They don’t run after women.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.130
Women don’t run after men.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:38.010
They are together, they sit together, talk
together, laugh together, but it is purity

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.261
that is here.

00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:49.210
In the Koran it’s described that “When
Kiyama will come, beautiful women and beautiful

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:54.579
men will be there, but they’ll have no lust
and greed, they’ll be pure.”

00:39:54.579 --> 00:40:05.319
Is today, you can see that that lust and greed
is finished in most of it, most of you.

00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:12.190
Automatically it is finished and now you can
see for yourself that you’re free of this

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.910
bondage.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:27.599
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow.

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:36.790
In the sahaj dharma, first thing is very important
is forgiveness.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:42.660
If somebody cannot forgive, then he cannot
be a Sahaja yogi.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.470
Forgiveness.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:51.220
How this forgiveness comes in is by forgetting
the past.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:56.559
Otherwise you’ll go on saying, “This person
tortured me, that person tortured me, he was

00:40:56.559 --> 00:41:01.510
very mean to me, he was that to me, he did
this to me.”

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:08.040
Shows that you are not of that caliber to
understand Sahaja Yoga - because you cannot

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.890
forgive.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.890
What is there to remember?

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.890
The present is the best.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:18.450
Now if you are sitting here with Me, enjoying
the alladhadayini shakti, that time if you

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:23.160
are thinking about the past, shows what?

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.400
That you are not of the caliber.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.790
To be the caliber of Sahaja Yoga, you should
be free of your past.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.790
Finished.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.569
There's no need to confess.

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:42.630
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to Me of confessions and I just said,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.590
“Baba, just burn these letters.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.630
I don’t remember.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.510
I don’t want to read anything about anything.”

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.890
So, there should be forgiveness.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:57.760
If there is forgiveness, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll feel very relieved and your married

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.079
life will be very happy.

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:06.609
But if you try to remember something – all
right, some marriages are really, really very

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:08.710
difficult, all right, so you get out.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:15.680
In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed complete divorce,
but must be with some reason, not because

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.420
you think something is superior.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.390
Now we have banned many countries from where
we don’t want to have girls or from where

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.472
we don’t want to have boys.

00:42:25.472 --> 00:42:27.040
What is the reason?

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:34.400
With experience we have learned, they are
not marriage substance.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:46.839
Now, then better not marry, and if you marry
then live like an ideal Sahaja Yogi.

00:42:46.839 --> 00:42:52.980
Also, if you are a Sahaja Yogini, then you
can carry on very much better by forgiving

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.740
all the time.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:01.950
Every time, when people tell Me, “My Mother,
You see You must help me.”

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:02.950
“Why?”

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.120
“Because, You know my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.120
I said, “Give him up.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120
I don’t mind.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120
He must give you money.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.520
Why doesn’t he give you money?”

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.670
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say, “Mother,
she’s very extravagant.”

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:21.670
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:29.619
In sahaj dharma, the husband-wife’s relation
should be really romantic, should be really

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:30.619
beautiful.

00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:37.369
It is not, you know, we talk of love and all
that here, very rarely people fall in love

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:38.980
and carry on with it.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:43.579
It’s a blessing if you really get that kind
of a feeling.

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.900
But mostly it is a curse.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:56.910
So to fall in love is very good but that doesn’t
mean you forget that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:02.250
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,
in your married life.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:09.380
Same dharma is for your children, that you
bring up your children not troubling them

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.849
too much, but into a free land.

00:44:12.849 --> 00:44:16.279
Let them use their wisdom.

00:44:16.279 --> 00:44:20.369
Sometimes I know children go astray and try
to follow wrong things.

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:23.970
Then you must correct them, you must tell
them, it’s your duty.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:30.109
They were not born out of the trees but they
were born here, from the parents.

00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:35.520
So it’s the duty of the parents to tell
them that this is wrong and this should not

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520
be done.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:44.119
It’s a very wrong thing, you should correct
them and that correction should be in a Sahaj

00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:45.119
way.

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:50.099
I’ll tell you an example.

00:44:50.099 --> 00:45:01.339
I had a problem once with somebody coming
to Me and saying, “Mother, I can’t do

00:45:01.339 --> 00:45:04.390
without smoking, I have to smoke.”

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:11.339
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi, because smoking Sahaja Yogi

00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:16.230
is a funny caricature, you know, I can’t
think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.839
How will I look if I start smoking like that?”

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:20.200
“Ah, horrible.”

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:27.710
I said, “Then if you are My son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.”

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.440
He gave up smoking, can you imagine?

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.609
So, dealing with children, always make yourself
an example, yourself part and parcel of that

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:38.609
event.

00:45:38.609 --> 00:45:43.960
So the children don’t feel, you know.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:51.690
This is something that I have talked many
a times.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:58.339
Children is one thing, I tell you, they can
give up everything but not your love.

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:10.150
If they know you love them they will not accept
anything that will make you not love - not

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:11.579
love them.

00:46:11.579 --> 00:46:20.740
This is for definite, because children are
the best people who know about love.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.690
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that in
English language, I didn’t see many books

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.230
about children written beautiful, beautiful
things.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:35.789
There was one book that was published when
I was in London: The children talking about

00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:42.670
the politicians, and they published I think,
5000 books and that very same day it was finished.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.450
So, talk to children, talk to them.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.680
You’ll be amazed, they are full of honey.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:57.230
They have such nice, nice things with them
and when they talk like that, then you are

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:04.369
amazed how they say things, how they talk
of Sahaj, how they are expressing their spiritual

00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:06.799
strength.

00:47:06.799 --> 00:47:18.549
Now, we have many very good children and also
they are absolutely Sahaj.

00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:24.220
One boy came and he just prostrated himself
before Me.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.400
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.915
“No, I was getting cool vibrations, Mother
from You, so I did it.”

00:47:30.915 --> 00:47:33.550
“Is it, you like it?”

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.800
“Of course!”

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.410
“More than chocolate?”

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.809
“Of course!”

00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:42.910
I was surprised.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:43.910
“What?

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.210
You eat them or what?”

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:53.359
“No need to eat, no, no, you feel so happy
inside and I feel, Mother, You are putting

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:56.980
Your hand on my heart and trying to console
me.”

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980
Surprised.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.869
“And where is your heart?”

00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:04.930
He said, “Here, here is my heart, I feel
it here.”

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:10.430
Just imagine, what love and what understanding
of Sahaja Yoga!

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.260
For these little children who are below even
five years.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:22.000
Now, you are all grown up children of Mine
and I want you to know all the beauties that

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.029
are within you, that you have to enjoy.

00:48:25.029 --> 00:48:27.799
First of all, learn to laugh at yourself.

00:48:27.799 --> 00:48:34.630
That’s the best way to enjoy yourself, you
know.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:40.210
And not to spend much time on the mirror,
in the mirror, that’s another way.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.160
You spend too much on the mirror, then something
wrong with you.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.692
I think, personally, that it’s a kind of
a possession maybe.

00:48:47.692 --> 00:48:55.780
So, what you should see inside, “Are we
sahaj dharmis?

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:01.829
Mother has established sahaj dharma, much
more than what Krishna wanted to establish.

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:08.450
He wanted to establish the dharma of love
which of course we have, but apart from that

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:16.930
we have so many other beautiful facets and
such beautiful things within our personality

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.029
that we have forgotten to enjoy.”

00:49:20.029 --> 00:49:31.130
So, the attention should be on your own qualities,
on your own personality, and then you’ll

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:39.130
be amazed how your personality is giving you
joy, giving you alladha, giving you so much

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:45.910
of patience with others.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:53.900
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke, because nothing so serious.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.789
It’s not a Rama’s type that you have to
be serious.

00:49:58.789 --> 00:50:01.359
I don’t have to kill anybody.

00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:07.160
I don’t use any weapons in this lifetime.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.520
Without weapons if things are solved, what
can you do?

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.690
But you must try to see the beauty as Sahaja
Yogis.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:20.829
You should be sensitive to see how you have
been helped, how you have been guided, how

00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:22.350
you have been blessed.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.790
This is sahaj dharma.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.910
If you cannot know that, then you live on
a very low level.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:36.869
I mean, it’s not fault of Sahaja Yoga, but
it’s your style, you are not sensitive.

00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:46.150
Supposing somebody is not - does not burn
his hand.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.799
So what will you do?

00:50:47.799 --> 00:50:52.250
He has no sense, he has no sensitivity, he
cannot feel.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:51:00.369
He can drink, he can smoke, he can do everything
and still he's existing, all right.

00:51:00.369 --> 00:51:04.070
Must be a rakshasa, I think or I don’t know
what to say.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:13.849
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis and not from the bad ones and

00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:21.250
how do we proceed in enjoyment - which is
a ocean, just a ocean.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.589
For example, now, I came, everybody was trying
to fan.

00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:32.750
But also in the West another problem is they
like to live in hermetically-sealed rooms,

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:37.250
hermetically-sealed cars, they are very afraid
of draft, I don’t know, as if they’ll

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.970
be blown away or what will happen to them.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:41.279
They don’t want draft.

00:51:41.279 --> 00:51:44.859
I mean draft is not coming from some iceberg.

00:51:44.859 --> 00:51:53.319
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air
at all and that’s one other reason that

00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:58.359
people are very suffocating sometimes, you
know, they just suffocate.

00:51:58.359 --> 00:52:01.789
They are used to a suffocating life.

00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:09.250
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so somebody
was driving Me, but the person who was there

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.880
was from Western country.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.289
He said, “Don’t open - don’t open the
window.”

00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:15.569
I said, “Why?”

00:52:15.569 --> 00:52:16.849
“There’s a draft.”

00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:23.020
I said, “In this country, in India people
live in the open - what is a draft?

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.500
What draft you are talking about?”

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.930
You can’t open the door, you can’t open
the window, you can’t open anything, if

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:34.720
you open anything, they’ll be all dead,
you see – as if.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.030
So open yourself!

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:41.269
As it is about the nature, also it is in their
private lives.

00:52:41.269 --> 00:52:49.390
They don’t want to open.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.950
If somebody comes to their house, “Oh my
God, now we’ll have to share the wines,

00:52:54.950 --> 00:53:00.200
we’ll have to share the foods” They cannot
share.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.589
They cannot share.

00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:10.869
That is most uncollective.

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:17.400
But in India, I must say, people have a good
sharing capacity because they are still primitive,

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:30.329
they are still primordial, yet not gone out
of the way to satisfy their own ego.

00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:44.500
But I think somehow or other in India, people
like to share.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.130
If you want to please any Indian, you tell
them, tomorrow I’ll come and have food with

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.130
you.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:50.130
His wife will jump.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:53.550
She’ll say, “Now what do you like, tell
me, what food do you like?”

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:56.269
She will jump.

00:53:56.269 --> 00:54:04.380
But otherwise, what happens, as soon as you
say he’s coming for food, the wife will

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:11.599
say, “No, no, I am going to my mother.”

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:17.520
Immediately she’ll have a program.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.029
I just don’t understand.

00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:25.480
They’ll have beautiful houses, very clean,
very beautiful, everything, but if somebody

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:31.059
comes to their house, they get a shock as
if electricity has entered.

00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:36.640
So, for whom is all this?

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.060
To show off, they will borrow money from the
banks.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.660
Even Indians in America they do.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:50.109
They want to have three Mercedes, four houses
- for what?

00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:54.500
Borrowing money with borrowing money they
live.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.789
Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow any money.

00:54:57.789 --> 00:55:03.779
There’s no need, you can do away with things.

00:55:03.779 --> 00:55:06.940
Why to have so many cars?

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:11.410
Nowadays, people don’t even walk at all.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:16.970
We used to go to our school, My father had
a car in India - nothing doing.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:18.609
We had to walk.

00:55:18.609 --> 00:55:20.920
We used to climb one mountain.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.920
It was about five miles, the school - every
morning.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:33.019
Then in the night, in the evening, the car
used to come, and I would walk with My bare

00:55:33.019 --> 00:55:39.220
feet, because so much vibrations and on the
chappals, I thought were cutting my vibrations,

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.390
so I used to have chappals in My hand and
walk.

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:48.460
One day we had a new driver, My father sent
him.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.859
He said, “How will I know who is the daughter.”

00:55:51.859 --> 00:55:58.890
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in
Her hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:06.990
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.869
It’s very important.

00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:10.990
And not to side with anyone.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:15.130
You are not identified with anyone.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:21.490
It’s much better now, I think, because since
you have taken to sahaj dharma, I’ve seen

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:23.759
English will tell you what’s wrong with
English.

00:56:23.759 --> 00:56:26.750
Swiss will tell you what’s wrong with Swiss.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.450
Indians will tell you what’s wrong with
Indians.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.280
Actually, I learned from them.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.500
I don’t know these things are there.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.369
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with
Russians.

00:56:36.369 --> 00:56:40.420
They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us?

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:45.109
Where do we lack in this?”

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:55.299
Because the collectivity of being in one country,
say as an Indian, we see now, what’s happening

00:56:55.299 --> 00:57:00.049
in India, all corrupt, horrible, this, that.

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:03.109
So, I said, “All right, if you don’t like
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”

00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:09.509
No, no, no, that - we will stay here, but
this is a very corrupt government they are,

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:12.009
it’s very bad, this, that.

00:57:12.009 --> 00:57:20.930
Anywhere you go, you will find immediately
they see - because you don’t know they are

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:24.849
now chosen to change their country.

00:57:24.849 --> 00:57:34.440
I’ve taken up many questions now, of India
and I’m going to start working on that level.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:43.200
We've already started, in a way, for the destitute
women, then for other type of poverty and

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200
all that.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.539
Just by saying, remove poverty, poverty cannot
be lost.

00:57:45.539 --> 00:57:55.269
You have to have feeling for the poor, then
only - but you get with more that feeling

00:57:55.269 --> 00:57:56.349
because you are an Indian.

00:57:56.349 --> 00:58:01.020
You are an Indian, so what?

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.259
Your own brothers, sisters starving.

00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:09.411
You get that very deep feeling within you
if you are a sahaj dharmi.

00:58:09.411 --> 00:58:13.300
So, this is the new dharma we have established
now in this world.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:21.460
A new race, with a new dharma, which is much
above - even Shri Krishna’s vision is coming

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.460
true.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.589
He describes in the beginning.

00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:30.500
I think, He was not a good salesman, because
He describes the best first.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:36.760
You see the salesman first will start from
two rupees, then go onward to two thousand.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:44.839
But He first told us that you have to become
Sthita Pragya, means Sahaja Yogi - and then

00:58:44.839 --> 00:58:50.220
Shri Krishna was asked a question by Arjuna,
“What is a Sthita Pragya?”

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:56.810
Then He describes a Sahaja Yogi, that He describes
before, first chapter, second chapter is that,

00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:57.810
now.

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.530
Then the questions start.

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.819
You know, Arjuna was a great questioner, I
think.

00:59:03.819 --> 00:59:09.069
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this and what about that and what about

00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:10.069
that?”

00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:17.220
So He goes on explaining to him that “You
see, this is all just a maya, this is all

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:20.020
an illusion you have.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.630
Get out of this illusion.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:28.329
If once you get out of this illusion,” because
Arjuna said, “They are my relations, they

00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:29.769
are my teachers.

00:59:29.769 --> 00:59:31.340
How can I kill them?”

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.570
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:39.299
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are
being killed because they are not following

00:59:39.299 --> 00:59:42.589
the satya dharma, so it’s all right.

00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:44.510
What is your brother, what is your sister?

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:49.269
They are not following the satya dharma, so
you have nothing to do with them.

00:59:49.269 --> 00:59:54.089
If you can correct them and help them, it’s
all right, otherwise forget them.”

00:59:54.089 --> 00:59:58.250
First, deal with people who are straight.

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:04.920
Like we should say that we must deal with
people who are simple, innocent and then you

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.259
can take to difficult people when you are
that good.

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:13.099
Otherwise you’ll come here saying, “Mother,
I have caught this, I have caught that.”

01:00:13.099 --> 01:00:20.800
So, in sahaj dharma, you being the spirit,
you also know about others, very well and

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.789
you can make it out, who is who, what chakras
they are catching.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:34.410
But the trouble in America, I found that Sahaja
Yogis used to, just could go and tell somebody,

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:37.240
“You are catching on this chakra.”

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.080
Now, he has come for the first time and you
tell him, “You, you are very egoistical.”

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.240
He says, “How do you know?”

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.690
“Your Agnya is catching.”

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.869
Maybe, his own Agnya might be catching.

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:51.130
Is this the way to receive a new person?

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.750
Is this the way to talk to a new person?

01:00:54.750 --> 01:01:00.950
See, on the contrary, you should say, “Come,
sit down, very nice, you are very great,”

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:01.950
see?

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:08.010
Because they are still ignorant, so they like
some sort of buttering, as you call it, you

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:11.100
see, we call it chaplusi.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:17.760
Then, gradually, because you are doing this
just to make him a Sahaja Yogi, because you

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760
love him.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.380
Basically that is the reason.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:25.950
But as soon as somebody comes in, if you tell
him, “This is wrong with you, that’s wrong

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.950
with you.”

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:33.970
This is not a pope’s business where you
go on telling people what’s wrong with them,

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:38.240
go and confess to all these silly people.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240
It’s not that.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:45.000
What we have to show that you have fallen
in love with that person; you are nice to

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.741
that person because you like that person.

01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:50.130
Then gradually you pull him up.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:54.990
But as soon as he comes you give him one shock,
so finished.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:57.840
How can you have good relations?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.740
Americans have to learn this.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.289
I don’t know why Americans think they are
very superior people.

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:08.289
I tell you for wisdom, I would not say they
are so good.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:12.430
It’s completely lacking – wisdom in them.

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:16.190
And they misunderstand people very fast.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:20.770
Start judging others, is not the way you can
have sahaj dharma.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.890
Sahaj dharma is: you are your own.

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:28.099
You are in your own, you are in your own realm
and in your happiness and joy.

01:02:28.099 --> 01:02:33.280
Where is the time to criticize others?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.869
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone.

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:45.900
In that love you should not show your pity,
but love which is, again, alladhadayini.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:51.279
This is the message of Shri Krishna, but I
don’t know how many understood it.

01:02:51.279 --> 01:02:56.660
Now, what you find those who are following
Shri Krishna like Hare Rama people, they are

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:00.779
really beggars on the street.

01:03:00.779 --> 01:03:05.670
He is Kubera, and his disciples are all beggars,
can you imagine?

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.599
Does it add to His glory as a Kubera?

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:13.710
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:21.510
Should be generous, should not bother too
much about yourself.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:29.069
Should not all the time think about yourself,
but think of the collectivity, how you behave.

01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:37.700
Collectivity is not to bring - force people
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:43.170
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they will know
the joy of life and you don’t have to tell

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.170
them anything.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:51.380
Nothing has to be told, just silently it will
work and they will feel your love.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.099
You see, love is something so great.

01:03:55.099 --> 01:04:00.529
It not only helps others but it also helps
you.

01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:03.549
It’s so joyous to give realizations to others.

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:09.619
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra
is catching”, why you are giving realization?

01:04:09.619 --> 01:04:13.039
If you don’t know how to give realization,
better not do it.

01:04:13.039 --> 01:04:18.650
So, to criticize is not the way we can enjoy
love.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:25.530
Ah, of course you can pull legs of each other
sometimes, just for fun’s sake, but not

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:32.920
to harm, not to torture, not to make that
person fall.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:43.369
You are all sahaj dharmis, you have accepted
sahaj dharma and in sahaj dharma we have to

01:04:43.369 --> 01:04:53.720
have pure love of the heart, not hypocrisy
- and sensible life.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.030
Now, this pope is against abortion.

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:58.130
I’m not.

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:03.539
If a woman is suffering, let her have abortion.

01:05:03.539 --> 01:05:08.820
The one who is living is more important than
who are not living.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.769
If somebody wants to have abortion, that child
can be born again.

01:05:13.769 --> 01:05:18.090
According to us, nobody dies permanently.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:22.890
Whatever it may be.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:32.349
So, this is one way they use it for propagation
of human beings.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:35.100
Like they say the Muslim women are like a
factory.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:38.740
They go on producing more children, more children,
more children.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.970
So there are more voters.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.430
So the pope knows that.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.890
That’s why he says, abortion, no.

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:55.369
Christians should not abort, because then
there will be less Christians to compete with

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.590
the Muslims.

01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:01.480
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such funny,
radical, nonsensical things.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:12.619
We have divorce, and we have also abortion,
which is important to understand that these

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:17.549
are all taboos which are there.

01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:27.690
But not for people who have to get out of
the troubles - you have to have it.

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:29.330
And that’s how it works.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:35.859
But to be very frank, we don’t have to do
abortions, it is achieved by Paramchaitanya.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:39.590
Paramchaitanya does for Me.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:41.309
I don’t have to.

01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:44.170
I don’t have to do anything.

01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.569
It’s Paramchaitanya.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:52.150
It’s nice, because it knows what is to be
done, how to achieve it.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:56.990
And sometimes you are in trouble, then know
that you are not leaving things into the hands

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.799
of the Paramchaitanya.

01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:06.450
If you leave into the hands of Paramchaitanya
things will work out very well.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:12.710
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and foremost
thing is, how much you are enjoying yourself.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:17.059
How much enjoyment you are giving to others?

01:07:17.059 --> 01:07:21.039
For that you have music, you have this, that.

01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:30.809
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna 

01:07:30.809 --> 01:07:33.480
you can’t keep quiet.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.940
He played murli, basuri, flute.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.619
Look at Him.

01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:44.390
I talked to Him, but He just played murli.

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:52.329
He didn’t talk so much, except for the Gita,
you won’t find Him talking.

01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:56.329
And those who read also Gita are horrible
people, I tell you, I have met - those who

01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:57.329
read Gita.

01:07:57.329 --> 01:08:01.260
They don’t understand what is Shri Krishna’s
dharma is.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.000
If they don’t understand Shri Krishna, how
will they understand Sahaja Yoga?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:20.860
So, for all of you is to practice on love,
on forgiveness, on appreciating others, on

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:24.359
giving joy to others.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:28.700
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind
to Me also.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:32.740
Once I went to the shop to buy a sari for
Myself and the sari was very expensive for

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.730
My purpose.

01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:38.730
So, I didn’t buy.

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:42.730
Said, “Let it be.

01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:45.970
This color suits Me, all right, but doesn’t
matter.”

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.920
I didn’t have so much money to buy.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.909
So, that Sahaja Yogi bought that sari and
on My birthday gave Me - and really, I could

01:08:54.909 --> 01:08:56.213
not see it, because My eyes were filled with
tears.

01:08:56.213 --> 01:08:57.213
Just a small thing like that.

01:08:57.213 --> 01:08:58.213
Normally I don’t expect you to do anything
for Me, no.

01:08:58.213 --> 01:08:59.213
But small, small things make you so happy.

01:08:59.213 --> 01:09:00.213
But even if you do this to somebody, may not
understand, may not realize, may not feel

01:09:00.213 --> 01:09:01.213
it.

01:09:01.213 --> 01:09:03.690
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, you will.

01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:04.690
So thank you very much for all this that I
have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and

01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:05.690
make others enjoy you.

01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:06.690
May God bless you!

01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:07.690
Lecture after some music:

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:08.690
You can see I’ve become black today because
of Shri Krishna.

01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:09.690
It’s very interesting how everything in
this world moves according to the desire of

01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:10.690
the Paramchaitanya.

01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:11.690
It’s very surprising.

01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:12.690
I wanted them to make a film about fundamentalism.

01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.690
It’s done very well.

01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:14.690
And we might be able to show it in India – maybe,
because they have already asked Me to make

01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:15.690
some episodes of My life, which they would
like to show, one after another.

01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:16.690
Somehow in India in the television we have
many Sahaja Yogis, I didn’t know.

01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:17.690
Even the director, deputy director, they were
all Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:18.690
And once they came to see Me in Delhi in our
ashram and said to Me - somebody said, “Mother,

01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:19.690
You don’t like media, but what about television?”

01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:20.690
I said, “Don’t talk to Me about television.

01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:21.690
They are horrible people there, ruining our
lives,” and I gave a very big lecture, you

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:22.690
know, for about five minutes.

01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:23.690
So, two persons came before Me, holding their
ears, they said, “Mother, we’re sorry,

01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:24.690
but we belong to the television.”

01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:25.690
“I see, I’m sorry, if I’ve said something.”

01:09:25.690 --> 01:09:26.690
Then they said, “I’m the director and
he’s the deputy director of the All-India

01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:27.690
Institute of Television.”

01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:28.690
Can you imagine?

01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:29.690
“Oh, My God,” I said, “I never knew
you were here and I’m sorry for what I’ve

01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:30.690
said.”

01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:31.690
So they wanted to have My – I think I had
three interviews with them.

01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:32.690
They said, “Mother, we’ll not ask You
a question.”

01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.690
All right.

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:34.690
“But then You come and sit wherever You
want to sit and we’ll organize everything

01:09:34.690 --> 01:09:35.690
and we want to show to the people what is
reality.”

01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:36.690
I was so surprised, you know, they did it,
no doubt.

01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:37.690
But last time when they wanted to do it I
was not in Delhi and I couldn’t do it.

01:09:37.690 --> 01:09:38.690
So I said, “Next time I’ll try to do something.”

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:39.690
They said, “Why not You give some episodes
to us?”

01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:40.690
I think the films I’ve seen which these
– the Americans, the great, have made – all

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:41.690
of them I would like to give them.

01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:42.690
But the second part of Christians also must
be shown, to give a balance.

01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:43.690
And also of the stupid Hindu – you call
them – false gurus.

01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:44.690
So like that we can have a combination of
three films.

01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:45.690
In that you can show about Hare Ramas, how
they are begging, and how other people are

01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:46.690
beggars - like Jehovah’s’ Witness.

01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:47.690
But apart from that, Christianity works out
everything secretly, you see.

01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:48.690
So you have to expose some things also there.

01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:49.690
Because it is, on top it’s very nice, very
good to talk to and all that, but inside they

01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:50.690
are doing all kinds of things, and making
people take to, what you can say, something

01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.690
very sinister.

01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:52.690
Something very wrong.

01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:53.690
Now they – unless and until you expose all
these three it won’t have a balance, I think,

01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:54.690
and then we can talk about Sahaja Yoga as
well.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.690
I’m very happy the way the film was made,
I’m very, very happy.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:56.690
That the Muslims are, poor things, from childhood
are taught to hate everyone.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:57.690
At least in Christianity they talk of love.

01:09:57.690 --> 01:09:58.690
Talk, talk – again I say.

01:09:58.690 --> 01:09:59.690
Because they have had so many wars and so
many nonsensical things.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:00.690
Now we can put forward in these films, say
for Christians we can put forward Gnostics.

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:01.690
We can put forward in the Muslim thing how
the real person was Ali, how He was murdered,

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.690
His wife, his children were murdered and what’s
going on now.

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:03.690
It’s quite a bold theme which you have to
put in.

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:04.690
And by doing all these things nobody gets
anything – peace or joy, which is promised

01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:05.690
by religion.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:06.690
So, these religions have no meaning.

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:07.690
The religion within is very different, which
is to be awakened.

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:08.690
And once it is awakened we all become one.

01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:09.690
We have to come to that point.

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:10.690
So, I think this film as it is - is all right,
it could be little bit shortened here and

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:11.690
there, plus you must have another film and
another film.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:12.690
Then these three films, if they are ready,
I’m sure, will be able to show the nonsense

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:13.690
that is going on.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:14.690
The Muslims are against Christians more, also
against Jews.

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:15.690
But Christians they are against, because they
think this Christian religion gives complete

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:16.690
freedom to do what you like, their women go
nude, they wear very scanty dresses, and the

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:17.690
women are like prostitutes and men are, I
don’t know, they run after women and men

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:18.690
run after.

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:19.690
So that’s the only job they’ve got.

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:20.690
They haven’t got anything higher, anything
great.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:21.690
So they are against – they think that they
must put some taboos.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:22.690
But I like the way you showed about these
people from Colombia – aboriginal.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:23.690
I’m going to talk about them in Ganesha
Puja.

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:24.690
They are worth lots of things more than you
know.

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:25.690
So we have to see to this, that what is wrong
in all these things?

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:26.690
In Sahaja Yoga we attend to our primordial
taboos.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.690
They’re primordial.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.690
These taboos are primordial.

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:29.690
And if you cross them and if you leave your
maryadas, then – whether you are a Muslim

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:30.690
or a Hindu, you cannot be saved, you cannot
get your realization.

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:31.690
So in Sahaja Yoga the built-in dharma within
us is awakened and we take to primordial taboos

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:32.690
which are meant for a human being.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:33.690
If a human being does not observe these taboos,
then what happens: whatever is happening in

01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:34.690
America or Iran or any other country.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:35.690
So what are the primordial taboos and all
that I am going to discuss in Ganesha Puja.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:36.690
And once that is awakened within us I don’t
tell you, “Don’t do this and don’t do

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:37.690
that,” there’s no need, because it’s
all awakened within you and you just don’t

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:38.690
do it.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:39.690
So that is has to be brought in this way.

01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:40.690
But the filming was very good, acting was
excellent, I must say, but we can write another

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:41.690
story without Me, if you possible.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:42.690
Of course this will be all right for Indians,
they will understand.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:43.690
But if you show this to any Muslim country,
they’ll be shocked.

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:44.690
For that I would say that this gentleman who
was this Rouhani – Ayatollah Rouhani – he

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.690
sent a very nice letter, say that “In the
Koran it is written that to follow a religion

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:46.690
you read about it.

01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.690
The main thing is you have to know yourself.

01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:48.690
If you do not know yourself, you can never
know God.”

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:49.690
It’s written, clearly.

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:50.690
So he said, “This great work is done by
Shri Mataji, is the work of Islam that She

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:51.690
is doing.”

01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:52.690
It’s a big, sort of, what you can call a
big certificate because he is head of all

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:53.690
the Shias of Europe.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:54.690
So that is how, if we want to make people
happy we cannot discipline them, we cannot

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:55.690
tell them, “Don’t do this, don’t do
that.”

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:56.690
Only thing you better awaken them.

01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:57.690
As soon as there is light within you, you
see for yourself what’s wrong.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:58.690
Of course, some people do get it much faster,
I must say, much deeper.

01:10:58.690 --> 01:10:59.690
But some have ego, some have conditionings.

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.690
So still they go back to it and again come
back to it, you see it’s like that.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:01.690
But mostly Sahaja Yogis, once they get to
Sahaja Yoga, they go deep into it – mostly.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.690
And I must say that we are now sending lots
of Russians to America, they will solve the

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:03.690
problem.

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:04.690
May God bless you!

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:05.690
[Hindi ?]

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:06.690
It’s not so easy, let it be.

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:07.690
Another very great miracle I must say, I was
to go to Russia, but felt sick and I had to

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:08.690
take rest, couldn’t go to Russia.

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:09.690
And the Russians had prepared for the marriages,
you see.

01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:10.690
So then they thought we could have marriages
in Cabella.

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:11.690
I said, ”That’s absurd, because we can
have an English marriage, but not possible

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:12.690
to have an Indian marriage in Cabella.

01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:13.690
Will be very difficult.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:14.690
But a thing happened, you see, to convince
Me.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:15.690
I said, “The biggest problem will be about
saris for the brides.”

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.690
Because nobody can select.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:17.690
I have to go and select, and how will it happen?

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.690
And suddenly somebody told Me, “Mother,
we have some very nice saris.”

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.690
“Very nice saris?

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:20.690
Bring them along.”

01:11:20.690 --> 01:11:21.690
I was amazed - there were seventy-two saris,
very beautiful with very good zuri work, just

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:22.690
for the bride, in red color.

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:23.690
Can you imagine?

01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:24.690
I said, “This is Shri Krishna, Who has sent
the saris, as He had supplied it at the time

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.690
when Draupadi asked for saris, you see.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:26.690
After that I decided, “All right, what may
come, we must have the weddings.”

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:27.690
So there might be some, some maybe, I don’t
know what will be, some handicaps, doesn’t

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:28.690
matter, but it’s a very big venture, I think,
to marry you people here with American arrangements

01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:29.690
and in Indian style in Italy.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:30.690
So all of you have to be very happy about
it and join in every way, and actually it

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:31.690
has worked out so well that I am Myself surprised.

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:32.690
So, this Paramchaitanya is working, but this
time specially, supplying sari is the job

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:33.690
of Shri Krishna, you know, and He’s done
His job very well.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.690
So I wish you all great luck for enjoying
these marriages.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.690
Now the time is little too much, but because
of short time we have something to do now

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.690
is to announce the marriage we have thought
was the best for the people.

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:37.690
Imagine, they said at the most seventy or
eighty marriages, now they are one hundred.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:38.690
Hundred and eight!

01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:39.690
Now so, people who are remarrying, we have
arranged something else for them, but who

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.690
are marrying for the first time.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:41.690
So if you don’t mind I’ll ask somebody
to read the names of the couples now, because

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:42.690
we have no time, you see.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:43.690
It’s such a fast running train, you know.

01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:43.699
So Yogi, the great, is going to do that.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:29.080
We talk to you directly about things and though
you know I’ve been looking after 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.570
you very well…

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.320
[Marathi ?]

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.080
And I didn’t have so much time but you know
I have to work very hard and when you have

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.220
only one program, I have three or four programs
and I’m working very hard for them.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:56.030
And you see, I’ve told you that Maharashtra
is going to be very fast movement and we have

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.270
to move very fast.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.370
Now what you have to understand is that you
have come for this program of Maharashtra

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.420
for what?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.560
Why have you come here?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
That people must understand.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.159
What I find that there is no understanding
of this simple fact…with some people…Some

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.510
people are murmuring souls among you and they
don’t understand why are they here.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.340
They are here to learn certain things for
Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.960
Now, especially if you do not have an ashram
also there’s always a problem to learn how

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:45.310
to live with others and in a way that we should
move 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.119
in a Spartan way, in a Spartan way, how to
live in a Spartan way and how to be smart.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.259
Now see these people here, Maharashtrians
are.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.060
Just look at them, you have to learn from
them.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.770
How quick - I don’t have to tell them anything.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.999
See they are so self disciplined within themselves…

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.950
I don’t have to tell them anything.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.109
You see, they organize, they’re working
so hard, you can’t imagine.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.520
You are doing no work, if you look at it,
what work are you doing?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.130
Just taking your luggage, putting on the busses,
getting down, sleeping again.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.850
What work are you doing compared to them?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.000
But there is no smartness about it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.320
What I find, they themselves are seeing you,
they think you are all lethargic people and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.250
some of you are druggist or what is it?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.970
And the complaints are so funny, that as if
you think there’s a package deal of a touring

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.190
thing, bus going and the organization is not
good and some are dominating, and this and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.190
this.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.000
It’s absolutely absurd, I think.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.820
Some people are taking Sahaja Yoga as a lethargic
stuff, you see, like a drug business, that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.420
you get into lethargy, nobody has to tell
you: “Get into the bus.”

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.880
But why don’t you get yourself?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.940
Everybody must organize, must learn something,
otherwise it’s a waste.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.810
I think it’s a waste coming down.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.120
You have not come here for a tourism.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.560
One thing.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.510
Must understand, this point must be understood
by all of you: it’s not tourism department

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.080
working this for you!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.250
Little comfort you get immediately you get
into that nonsense and you must know that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.450
too much of materialism has brought you to
this stage that you have too much of Ego.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.010
It’s a big headache - for Sahaja Yoga and
for you also.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.010
You know that!

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.730
Too much of materialism.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.730
And this matter always tries to overpower
the Spirit and your Spirit is always overpowered

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.920
by the Spirit.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.710
And you get into a lethargic mood and then
anybody tries to tell you: “Get fast or

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.530
get do”, you think, “You are dominating!”
and “This is a - This is a nonsense”,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.740
I can’t understand this!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.900
Now why aren’t they seeing they want to
do any more organizing?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.430
Who wants to do it?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.890
Now, those who were complaining raise your
hands.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.890
Take it over.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.890
Good idea!

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.200
He says: “I don’t want to do any organizing”.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
All right!

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.350
Who wants to do it?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.320
Let’s see who were complaining that he was
crossing the maryadas.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.870
Now let them take over!

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.730
It’s not the way to behave.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.980
You see, you must have your own disciplining,
you must learn disciplining.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.500
People have taken many things for granted.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.190
You see and that’s what happened with Nick
when he tried to do.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.200
They are very comfortably settled down in
Linda’s house.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.289
And there also I’ve seen people do the same
thing.

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.160
Because when you – they live there, there’s
no need to have any disciplining, there is

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160
nobody to tell.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.080
That’s not lethargy!

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.729
Sahaja Yoga is a Spartan thing, a smart stuff.

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.120
See, look at these people, how smart they
are.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.990
Early in the morning, 5.30 they’re up and
they are doing the jobs.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.650
You see the way they are organizing, you can’t
imagine how much they are organizing.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.069
In far fetched places, here also to organize
everything is an impossible situation.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.270
Now what are we doing?

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.169
Just trying to think that, you see, “We
are in a very package deal, we are here and

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.180
that everything should come to us in a way
that is a tourist, this thing.”

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.669
Now Warren has retired, now, who wants to
do the job, let me see?

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.729
Those who have complained should I put?

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.419
What’s this going on, I just don’t understand.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.509
One person starts a joke and everybody starts
with it - it’s absolutely wrong, there’s

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.849
no tourism going on.

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.840
You better go back, I’ll return all your
money that you paid Me and you go back.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.380
Here you have come to learn about Sahaja Yoga,
how to become smart, how to be Spartan, how

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.380
to be light.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.710
How much your Mother is working at this age?

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.550
I’m sixty years of age.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.020
How much I’m working - just look at that.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.419
You have to be - I’m your ideal or queen
Elizabeth?

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.419
Who is your ideal?

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.660
I mean I just don’t understand.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.039
Why are you here?

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.050
And one person starts a joke, another takes
it over and they all start talking like this.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.029
This it’s absolutely an impossible situation.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.639
I don’t have to tell them, even once.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.520
Can’t imagine?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.689
In the night they cook the food for you, you
know?

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.659
In the night - After the program, they came
down, made all that food for you here and

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.129
we took it.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.259
Those who were with Me know that.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:19.400
They cooked the food, all of them, these young
boys and again up they are in the morning

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.930
5.30 organizing everything.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.930
Look at that!

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.050
Learn from them!

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.229
You see, you people, in quality are no good,
must understand.

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.750
You have nothing but Ego and a self-consciousness
that you are very great.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.500
No, you are not!

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.409
I’ve to tell you very frankly.

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.580
You have to come down with that Ego, completely.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.979
Material development has ruined you completely
there.

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.770
You see thousands of people raising here their
hands.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.499
See the people here!

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:53.560
Are we going to forget all the civilization
that’s doomed one in the West?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.680
You are the people, who are the foundation.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.909
What are you, you are not saints, are you
not?

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.520
How does a saint live?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.339
You have seen Ramdasa Swami, I went to see.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:10.969
Now do you realize that you went to Mahalakshmi,
that’s one of the - one of the pithas of,

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.190
one of the Kundalini’s pitha, you see, of
the whole Universe.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.190
Did you follow that?

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:24.009
Looking after your comfort state or looking
after your Spirit, what are you doing here?

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.280
Did you go - did you understand that the temple
was for that?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.860
Did you follow that point?

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.180
And now I want you to see another temple and
then another temple I’m going to have.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.580
It’s not so easy, no tourist has gone to
these temples.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.020
Actually no Indians are - no foreigners are
allowed in these temples.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.990
Because you are saints they have allowed you,
but behave like saints.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.539
What’s this nonsense going on?

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.370
Talking about comfort, this nonsense.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.979
What comfort do you have there?

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.539
I feel most uncomfortably in the Western countries.

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:59.819
There’s no comfort of the Spirit.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.669
Most uncomfortable I feel.

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:07.749
Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically
- so materialistic, so materialistic.

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:08.749
Horrible!

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:15.559
Now don’t think too much of yourself for
Heaven’s sake.

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:20.590
I don’t want you to talk that somebody’s
dominating you, crossing your maryadas, Sahaj

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.590
means lethargy.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.849
Why don’t you have your own Spirits and
your own arrangements?

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:29.840
Everything you have misleft, 2 rooms, 4 rooms
there unlocked this thing.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.640
There’s one girl looking after Me, how smart
she is, just see how smart she is.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.159
Even ten English girls can’t look after
Me the way she looks after Me.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.250
Every little bit of that she knows.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.200
I’m not saying only English but all of you
have this problem.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.510
Please get rid of it!

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:54.110
Otherwise forget the West!

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.680
You have to do tremendous jobs.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.210
I’m trying to look after you the way I can.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.210
You have to look after yourself.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.230
The way you are moving I just don’t understand.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.050
Is it a package deal you have come?

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.970
Those who have come for the first time are
more troublesome also.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.339
Because they have never seen this before.

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.050
I mean those who want to go back, can go back
tomorrow.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.709
I’ll give you money, you go back.

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:17.570
Rahuri is going to be much worse than this.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.700
This is the first time you got a hotel - Aaaaa!

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.449
I mean, I don’t understand the way you have
to be feeling comfortable.

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:29.230
You want a bathroom?

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.079
All right, get attached to a bathroom and
move about with the bathroom all the tour.

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:40.399
I mean you know how I live in England, what
sort of a house I have and what sort of bathrooms

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.399
I have.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:46.250
I’ve have never complained, I’ve never
thought of it even.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.250
Never!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.180
For Me it’s the Spirit.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.550
And don’t think too much of yourself.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.550
Please!

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:57.990
Everything they are running, Puja they are
running, things they are running.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.760
Look at them!

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.710
Never a problem for Me.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.960
Now you have to go tomorrow to Tuljapur place.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.810
This Vitthala is a very big place here of
Vishuddhi that you have to see and you have

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.810
to go to Tuljapur.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.350
They are not comfortable that’s why they
never appear in the West.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.240
They are not comfortable there.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.130
Who would have built temples on these stones?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.130
They would have?

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:29.250
Do you think they would have understood Hanumana?

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.290
See the standards!

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.400
Look at him how he lived.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.740
Even a person like Shivaji, he lived here.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.740
He was a king!

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.069
I mean I have never put you to any test or
anything, but the amount of, you see, not

00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:46.639
that I want you to sleep in the cold or anything,
I didn’t want you to sleep in the cold,

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.730
that you misunderstood.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.009
But what’s this going on?

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:55.070
Why don’t you get up 5 o’clock everyday?

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.690
I sleep - I work much more than you too!

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.470
Today you know what programs you have?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.470
Puja here.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.529
You don’t have to run the - anybody’s
chakras, do you?

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:07.819
You don’t have to raise mountains of Kundalinis,
do you?

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:12.880
Stones and stones after thousands of - do
you have to do that?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.190
I need not talk about Myself.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:21.110
Then after that this program I have to deal
with intellectuals, then there’s a press

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:33.779
conference, then after the press conference
there’s a huge meeting at 6 o’clock.

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:44.720
The so-called comforts are nothing but enslavement
of your Spirit.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.740
It has enslaved your Spirit, the Spirit is
enslaved, believe Me.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.720
Get out of it!

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.079
It’s a nonsense!

00:11:54.079 --> 00:12:01.310
Your are saints, you are seekers of ages,
now get out of it, absolutely get out of it!

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:06.629
They are so Spartan, so smart.

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:13.440
Mooladhara is first class, just see….Early
in the morning, 5 o’clock bath and finished,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.899
they are ready!

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:20.560
What are you thinking all the time, that you
are lazy, every time people see - they told

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.699
me some are taking perhaps drugs.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:25.779
That’s what they felt the way some of you
are lethargic.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:30.480
What is there to tell you, you can’t get
into the bus and they can’t understand.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.430
In 5 minutes they’ll arrange things, 5 minutes.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:43.050
Can you imagine, after the program they came
here, cooked food and I was there.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:48.070
Now don’t think too much, thinking too much
makes you just lazy lumps….that’s all….it’s

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.100
not good.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.720
Thinking is another style of materialism,
is a subtler materialism.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.430
What is there to think?

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.300
[Get into bhoots ] Get rid of it!

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.779
And there is one bhoot who is of fussy one
here, I know all of them, very well, they

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:08.190
have been always a headache and I don’t
know why they have come and they introduce

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:15.590
to another person and that bhoot goes on,
on, on, on, on.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:22.720
But all such misfits will get out of Sahaja
Yoga, take it from Me!

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.250
They’ll get out!

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.160
You want Sahaja Yoga or not, that’s the
point.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.380
Then, why worry about comfort?

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.380
It’s most surprising!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.149
Some of you who have come for the first time
from such a long distances, like Frankfurt

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:41.130
people are perfectly all right, Toronto are
all right.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:50.790
From New York they are all right, these are
all right, Steven and his wife they are all

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.790
right.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.160
I mean they all have the same profile.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.870
Why other people?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.810
Now, please, try to give Me some joy.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.230
I don’t want to hear, “Now he wants to
resign.”

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:11.920
You see, everybody starts talking, “He’s
very dominating.”

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.240
But why?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.230
What are you?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.844
You don’t deserve any bad thing better,
do you?

00:14:17.844 --> 00:14:19.450
You have to be smart.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.790
Are you smart?

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:31.900
Your Mooladharas’ like stones hanging round,
all the time thinking, thinking - what?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:38.759
Clear your Mooladharas!

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:47.579
You must have Me as your ideal in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:50.560
Look at Me!

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.529
I mean, can you imagine?

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.670
I have so much [slunk ?]! I’m working very
hard, you know that!

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.670
I’m not - I’m marathon, you’ll go away.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.329
You’ll go to England, you’ll go away to
Europe, you’ll go away!

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.790
What about Me?

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:14.236
I’m still working, working, working, working…Only
reason is that I have a very good Mooladhara

00:15:14.236 --> 00:15:19.750
and a very good Agnya and an excellent Sahasrara!

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.100
I don’t think!

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.820
Talk too much, better not talk!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.389
I think you better stop talking to each other!

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:28.399
That’s the best way it will work out.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:34.779
All this nonsensical things you talk, you
have nothing great to talk, sublime things,

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:36.500
about God, about the Spirit.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.110
You must have peace in yourself!

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.149
If you have peace, you’ll enjoy it!

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.459
The whole place is so peaceful!

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:49.860
Why don’t you see the peace of this place
which is lacking in that horrible comfortable

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.860
place?

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.980
All of them!

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.579
There’s no peace.

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:56.060
Feel the peace, you are saints!

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.320
Feel the peace of this place; in their hearts
see - feel their peace.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.990
The riches have ruined you.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.020
That’s the curse!

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.050
That’s the curse!

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.699
So feel the peace of the place!

00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:17.670
There’s no peace within.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.350
Feel the peace within.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.749
What side of all these sides you see, anywhere
you go?

00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:29.600
”Oh very nice, this is very nice” What
is nice about it?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.249
The peace of it, the subtler side, you have
to be subtler persons to feel the subtle side.

00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:40.000
Feel the subtle side, the music behind, the
fragrance behind.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.569
If I’m your ideal, I feel very comfortably,
to be very frank.

00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:57.959
I don’t know when will I be out of that,
I call it vanwas, is that staying in a forest,

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.069
a jungle.

00:16:59.069 --> 00:17:07.490
I feel it’s a jungle of people who are anarchist,
arbitrary, such Ego oriented, horrible people

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.230
those who don’t know how to talk to each
other.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.230
Horrible!

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:16.120
I’m for vanwas, I hope it finishes after
12 years.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.810
It’s real vanwas for me!

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.829
But now, you people give me some hope!

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.539
Now, no more talking like this!

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:28.189
Shut up yourself for this point!

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:29.189
Absolutely!

00:17:29.189 --> 00:17:32.870
Nobody’s going to talk like this, it’s
anti-God.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.480
See, why are we here?

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.169
Get individualistic in the sense you sit down
for meditation, don’t talk.

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:41.279
Sit down for meditation!

00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:45.460
You see you are trying to find organization
mistakes.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.760
I just can’t understand, what is the matter?

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.600
Pull your ears for this, please pull all of
you.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:18:00.770
No more of this nonsense.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.059
And next time such people should not come,
I request such people who have been complaining

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:06.059
please don’t come.

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:08.730
Look at Genuine, she’s so old, she never
says anything.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.530
Whenever I ask her she says: “Mother, I’m
happy.”

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:17.210
You are not going to enjoy anything, you see,
because you are not subtle.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.309
Even coming to the subtlest places you don’t
enjoy anything.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.380
Where is your attention going?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380
Inward?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.160
Believe Me, they’re the most peaceful places
where you have been.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.880
But your brain will never allow, this brain,
this horrid Ego will never allow you to enjoy.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.450
So get rid of it!

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.650
All right?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.310
Please, I want you to enjoy.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.669
I brought you here to enjoy.

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:44.610
Don’t criticize!

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:51.740
And any side of comfort, you just get rid
of it.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.970
You’ve got a cot?

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.010
Sleep on the ground.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.010
Best is.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.610
Tell your body: “I’m here!

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.780
I’m a seeker!”

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:03.190
You must know your true nature that you are
seekers, you are not like other people but

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:19.630
that is still sticking on into your heads,
you still think on those lines.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.450
You must know that you should never challenge
anybody who’s organizing.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.030
That hurts Me!

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.030
Never!

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.789
He’s doing some job, you’re doing no job.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:30.789
Must do that!

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:32.059
What job are you doing?

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:34.580
Very nice to criticize another person!

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.460
What job are you doing?

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.940
Are you responsible for anything?

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.940
Even for your clothes?

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.240
He’s the one who is working hard, it’s
very nice to criticize such a person!

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.260
It’s like any Dick, Tom and Harry comes
and criticizes Me that: “Why don’t You

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.600
do this and why don’t You do that?”

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.460
Is exactly the same situation.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.700
You are doing no job, very nicely criticizing
others.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.810
Why, for what?

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:03.140
You think you’ve paid for yourself, you’ve
paid very little, not much, I know that.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:10.020
How much I had to take for your traveling
and the amount of luggage you have brought.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.560
It’s a big problem in these places.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.200
Even if you pay you can’t get it.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.029
But I’ve not brought you here to give you
comfort at all.

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:20.770
You must know I told you it’s a very Spartan
one.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.620
I’ve told you some that don’t get more
than 80 people.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.470
It’s an impossible situation.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.700
You can’t get busses, these are from the
state trading busses, we got with great difficulty.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.590
They gave us 2 busses, you see.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:38.730
They have their own passengers, they have
to sacrifice a lot.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.980
These are not the places we - I didn’t want
to travel this time, you remember.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.810
I was telling I don’t want to travel this
time with all of you.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.370
I want to go alone.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:57.850
I’ve told you that we have to spend some
money, more sometimes, sometimes less, sometimes

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.640
we have to spend quite a lot, much more than
we expect, sometimes it’s lucky that we

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640
have less money.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.390
Whatever money remains it will go for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.409
I don’t want your money, you know I’ve
already overspent My money.

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:11.409
My bank is exhausted!

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:13.650
You know that all!

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.169
So, why you talk like this?

00:21:16.169 --> 00:21:17.840
You don’t think how much Mother spends.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.039
You never think on that.

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.039
You know Portugal - what happened.

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:22.350
You know how much money I spent in England.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.950
Then you don’t think on these lines, do
you, ever?

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.580
Are you going to return that money to Me,
anyone of you?

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:38.080
But why stupidly talk like this, as if there’s
some tourism department going on, you paid

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.610
for the money, you paid for it, so you find
faults with the organizers.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.550
Give up all these bad habits, absolutely.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.610
Even if somebody beats you, you are not to
complain now, keep it on that point.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.580
Ego needs beating, nice beating, I tell you.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.730
Sometimes good beating will sort out all the
problems.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.059
Otherwise, if nobody beats you, beat yourself.

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:02.000
That’s the best way.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.899
Now not that everyone is like that; most of
you are very good, I know you are enjoying,

00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:14.029
but these are few people who are bhootish
and they are creating this problem and these

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:19.909
bhootish people will give others bhootish
nature, so be careful.

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:24.230
Those who have got the bhoots better turn
them out.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.530
Just don’t do anymore of this, just stop
it.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.880
All right?

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.510
We have to have self discipline.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:37.710
These people, look at these people, no problem,
no problem, such love, such organizing capacity.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:43.039
How much - from 3 o’clock they’re waiting
here for Me, 3 o’clock.

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:48.659
Every ended up, you see, they came back by
3 o’clock.

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:49.880
Twelve hours.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.179
Again today they are back for Puja.

00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:58.610
And they are engineers, they are doctors,
they are everything.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.980
At least everybody’s a graduate, at least,
minimum.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:12.230
It’s true that in England even a garbage
cleaner gets more money than these people

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.230
can get.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.230
But what, so what?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:20.919
Are they going to carry their money with them
or their bathrooms and their comforts?

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:25.990
All these mythical ideas you must give up.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.470
This is another world, that’s another world.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.710
You have to adjust yourself to this world.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.049
It’s very sickening to Me, I tell you.

00:23:34.049 --> 00:23:37.279
Even if there are one person like that, will
be so sickening.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:40.309
Now don’t pay any attention to anybody who
talks like that.

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:41.580
Just shut him down!

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.860
You are so many who are good, only there are
few who are funny.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.810
You just shut them down: “ Now you will
shut up, this is a bhoot!”

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.520
on this point.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.690
You must get up early in the morning, do your
meditation, get into busses.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:58.990
You are here for a package deal for one month
to spartan yourself.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.750
All right?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.260
So, it’s a promise.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.659
It’s a promise [since forward ?].

00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:11.130
Now with Rahuri it’s even much more, you
see.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:15.270
The villagers, they are going to get a shock
that I brought some drunkards with Me and

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:19.559
those who cannot get into the bus, can’t
get out, everything and, “I can’t do this

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:20.559
and I can’t do…”.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:24.890
Everything you have to do!

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.750
Just it’s a promise, it’s a promise.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.290
We are going to do it.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.560
All of us!

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
All right?

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560
Even I!

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.820
(Shri Mataji laughing) All right!

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.100
May God bless you!

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.769
So not to feel bad, most of you are all right,
most of you are enjoying, I’m not saying,

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:44.880
but there are few who are stupid and you don’t
listen to them!

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.029
Just don’t listen!

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:50.900
If somebody says that you shut that out, you’ll
be amazed if you shut that person out, you’ll

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:57.059
be amazed that person will improve, you’ll
help that person!

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.799
Nobody should talk like this!

00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:00.450
Noone should talk like this!

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.450
It’s nonsensical!

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.450
All right!

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.450
May God bless you all!

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:07.679
Let’s sit down with the Puja - with that
smartness!

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:11.279
We have to be smart not lethargic in Sahaja
Yoga!

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.279
Sahaja means what?

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:13.279
Like lazy lumps?

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:18.999
How are we going to do the work of the whole
world if we are lazy lumps?

00:25:18.999 --> 00:25:24.100
Imagine the amount of mountains we have to
lift in the West, to think of them.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.460
And here we are already exhausted…

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.080
Haaa - like that!

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080
What are we going to do that?

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080
Ha!

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.600
It’s a tremendous task!

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:39.169
See, it’s like, I don’t know what to say,
it’s like taming a hippopotamus or I don’t

00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:40.590
know what to say!

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.590
Horrible!

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.529
And you better smarten up yourself, maybe
next year I may never bring anyone of you,

00:25:46.529 --> 00:25:49.120
I tell you, I’m so fed up.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.380
But this is the style, is the last chance
perhaps, now I was saying it’s just last

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.270
time but everybody said: “No, no Mother!”

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.919
Is it, remember Gregoire…

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:01.140
I was not wanting, really, anybody to come!

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.519
It’s a headache you know!

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:05.480
You still carry the ideas.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.220
Now, so that’s Paul!

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.279
And look at down there!

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:10.419
Look at him!

00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:15.399
He’s any [UNCLEAR], he has a house of his
own, he has a wife, he has children, all that

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:17.390
he’s given up, he’s coming.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:18.590
Look at him!

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.110
He’s a big engineer with the Municipality,
he’s so doing so much of big, big bridges

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.250
and all that – he is here?

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:32.410
Do you see in it any Ego?

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.120
Do you find any Ego in him?

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.610
Learn, learn from them.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.230
If not from Me, from them.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.539
The one who arranged our program is a multimillionaire,
do you know that?

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:44.539
He’s a multimillionaire.

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:49.830
The one who took us to his to his farm house,
he’s a multimillionaire.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.580
But do you find anything, any …While my
grandchildren themselves have just come from

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.130
a multimillionaire family.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.580
Do you find that in them?

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.710
Why?

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:06.679
Not that they don’t have money, they don’t
have comforts.

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:12.260
But he told Me that “I haven’t got a car”
- he’s a multimillionaire, “because I

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.700
don’t need it, I need a jeep so I bought
five jeeps”.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.700
Finished!

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.679
But if somebody gets some money there, he’ll
have a swanky car to show off.

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:27.070
They can’t understand, “why to buy when
I don’t need it, I’m working on the farm”.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.070
Finished!

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:33.570
And you’re telling Me he‘ll go by ordinary
bus, he’ll do everything.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.572
He’s a multimillionaire, can you believe?

00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:37.010
Have you seen his business?

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:44.279
How many [looms ?] he has got, which is working
out?

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:50.160
Not that he’s miserly, how generous he was!

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.419
How his wife lives, how everything, just see!

00:27:53.419 --> 00:28:00.730
They might be having hundreds of diamonds
in the house but they don’t show off.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:10.679
I mean we must learn from them, you see, also
there are poor people, all of them are smart,

00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:11.679
very smart.

00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:12.680
They may live in a small, little tent but
you see, early in the morning they go to the

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.830
river, have their bath, they’re ready for
the job!

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.520
Smartness is one of the things you have to
get in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520
Spartan!

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.260
Living should be Spartan and smartness.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.590
Those two things you must keep in you.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:31.590
All right!

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:36.519
Otherwise they think half of you are sick.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:38.510
All right!

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.820
So no thinking, just now.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.130
Put yourself into Nirvichara.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:49.910
Watch Me, all of you, watch Me.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:57.120
Raise your heads again.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.720
All right!

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:08.630
You’ve got rid of your vices and things,
but now get rid of this nonsense, of a Ego.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.000
This is the biggest problem you have.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.160
The Ego is the biggest problem.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.360
And when you think you are dominated better
accept it - hundred times.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.360
Don’t tell others!

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:31.370
Who’s right sided, left sided, right sided,
left sided - everybody’s branding everyone!

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:40.080
In Sahaja Yoga nobody remains left, right
sided.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.260
Better?

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.620
Much better.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:30:12.320
Whatever is good for the Spirit, the enjoyment
for the Spirit, then you will be in 

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:32.760
the other world, you see.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:31:10.759
Forget this nonsensical world that you have
been.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:48.600
You 

00:31:48.600 --> 00:33:31.309
are all seekers, you are great people, God
gave you birth in that country, just to see

00:33:31.309 --> 00:34:18.139
what materialism is, not to get involved into
it.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:23.020
Get out!

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:32.780
But evolve!

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.440
Get out!

00:34:37.440 --> 00:35:09.520
We 
have all this poverty, we 

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:24.079
have all this discomfort.

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:40.130
See the peace.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:38:29.560
Feel the peace of the landscape, of human
beings, everybody has peace.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:39:04.020
Look the smart little children this age, so
happy here.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.770
All right?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.280
May God bless you!

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:24.589
And don’t look miserable, anyone of you.

00:39:24.589 --> 00:40:00.569
They can’t understand why are you looking
miserable.

00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:20.460
They are - 

00:40:20.460 --> 00:41:00.920
they think that they are 

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:26.559
not doing their work properly or you don’t
like the food.

00:41:26.559 --> 00:42:09.080
They just don’t understand because you look
so miserable, anxiety and tired for nothing

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.410
at all.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:31.380
All right, may God bless you!

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:38.660
Let’s have it now!

00:42:38.660 --> 00:44:54.450
Get up fast and go down!

00:44:54.450 --> 00:46:52.630
Let’s see 

00:46:52.630 --> 00:48:54.380
how fast you can get up.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:50:09.859
All right!

00:50:09.859 --> 00:52:24.500
Let’s see how you 

00:52:24.500 --> 01:44:07.940
get down.

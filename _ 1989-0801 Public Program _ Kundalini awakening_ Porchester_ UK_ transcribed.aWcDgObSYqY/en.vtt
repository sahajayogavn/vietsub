00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.580
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:38.060
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.590
We cannot conceptualize it.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.740
We cannot organize it.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.420
And we cannot use it for our own purposes.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:59.640
Moreover, with the blinkers on both the sides
like a horse, with all our conditionings,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970
we cannot find the truth.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.140
We have to be free people.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.540
We have to be open-minded people, like scientists,
to see for ourselves what is the truth.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.370
If somebody preaches something, professes
something, says something, is not to be accepted

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.060
blindfolded.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.080
As I told you yesterday, that the essence
of all the religions is to find the eternal

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:44.750
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding
and in its own limitations.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.730
That’s why we have lost our balance.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:03.360
If we are really the people who want to know
the truth, we have to know that at human awareness

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.500
we cannot know it.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.609
It becomes a concept.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:19.190
You have to have the spiritual awareness,
but spiritual awareness is a state of your

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.010
being, where you become the spirit.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.260
Again the word I’ll say – “become.”

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.930
It’s not artificially certifying somebody
that now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.090
or a Muslim, you become anything.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.590
Because you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu,
anything, you can commit any sin.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.850
You can do anything that is wrong.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.210
Nothing from inside is going to stop you.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.620
So all these things have become so much outward
that now there are people who have started

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.460
saying there is no God, there is nothing like
religion, which is not true.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.650
First of all when we say there is nothing,
or there is not God, we should find out, have

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:25.890
we been able to find out about it or just
in our ego we are saying there is no God?

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.740
Have we been able to work it out to see if
there is God or not?

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.500
You do not judge God by the people who talk
about God.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.470
Anybody can talk about God because they think
there’s no law that can catch them.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.360
They can talk against Him, they can talk for
Him, they can do the way they like.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.520
They can even make money by talking against
God and against all the prophets – that’s

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.250
a very good way of making money, blackmail.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.960
But does that mean that whatever is written
is a bible, or whatever is black and white,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.110
is to be taken that seriously?

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:20.400
So first of all, we have to be little independent
to be free, to know that if you have to know

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.500
the spirit - as they said “know thyself”
- then you have to know it on your central

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.220
nervous system.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:45.710
As I can feel this is cold or hot, you have
to feel the divine power which is all-pervading,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:55.870
which is the truth, which manifests the truth,
because it is the love of God.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:06.330
You have to first feel it on your central
nervous system, which is the bodha.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:14.270
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced
so much, all right.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.840
We have gone too far with everything.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.060
But if we see, when we started with science,
what have we produced?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.650
Hydrogen bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils
sitting on our heads.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:40.520
You take to any enterprise that we did, we
go to extremes.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.250
There is no balance.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.639
Any mental projection is linear, it moves
in one line and then recoils back, and then

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.139
you are shocked.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:52.900
Now you have got acid rain.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.270
You produced machinery, all right.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.320
Machinery is for you, you are not for machinery.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.190
And thus, there is no balance between you
and the machinery, no balance between you

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.190
and the science.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:18.380
It is just like going amok with anything that
you get into your hand.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:26.250
And this balance you can only have when you
become the spirit.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:33.130
You see beautiful chandeliers here, beautifully
made, but unless and until there is light

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.760
what is the meaning of these chandeliers?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.590
Nothing.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:47.270
In the same way, if you do not have the light
of the spirit shining in your attention, you

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.810
will not know your meaning.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:54.480
Like this instrument – unless and until
it is connected to the mains, it is useless.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:02.100
Unless and until we are connected to the mains,
we do not know the absolute, and that’s

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.310
why all these problems are there.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:18.880
Now when I am talking about this instrument,
which lies within us, one has to again know

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.790
that this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.690
And to know the knowledge of the roots, you
have to become a subtler personality.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.870
With a gross mind, you cannot see it.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:40.880
To become the subtler personality, minimum
of minimum, you have to know that so far you

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.680
have not known the roots.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.880
If you had known, there would be no problem.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:58.760
But there’s something has gone wrong somewhere
in every human enterprise, even in religions,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:09.010
that’s why today we find this kind of a
farce going on.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:16.550
And what is gone wrong is that we have to
seek the eternal.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:24.510
Maybe it might look a little different, for
example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.890
God at all.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:35.730
I also did not talk about God for four years,
at least three years.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:42.360
As soon as you talk of God, again people start
jumping, “When can we become God?”

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.300
– this is the first question.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.760
So first you become the self –the first
step.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.649
That’s why they did not talk.

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.370
They said first you become yourself.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:04.250
Unless and until you have your eyes, how can
you see the colors?

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.500
So first have your eyes.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:19.330
It is for your benevolence that you better
get what you deserve, what is your own.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.410
It’s your birthright as a human being to
become the spirit.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.870
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha means
“with” and ja is “born.”

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:40.060
Born with you is the right to get this yoga,
is the union with the Divine.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.760
It’s your birthright as a human being.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.890
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:59.600
And it has to work out, but please open your
hearts and open your minds.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.200
Just open it and see for yourself, it will
work, I know.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.660
Yesterday it has worked.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.370
It is going to work out today also.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:13.120
But by thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:24.260
This is the biggest problem of our seeking
that we run after some sort of a concept.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.420
Now here you have seen this instrument is
the most beautiful instrument that is created

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.760
within us during the process of our evolution.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:44.730
The first one is the most beautiful one because
it stands for our innocence.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:53.000
This innocence is the one which gives us real
support, real strength.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.560
And you’ll be surprised it is never destroyed.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.920
It may be overshadowed, there may be clouds.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.020
Maybe it may look to be a very dark sky.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.290
Maybe a hopeless case.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.139
Some people might say that we have destroyed
our innocence.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:20.320
It cannot be destroyed.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.170
Whatever you might have done, this is one
center which cannot be destroyed.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.270
You may have problems with it but it cannot
be destroyed.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:36.720
It is such a wonderful center you have got,
which has got four petals, which looks after

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:44.050
the pelvic plexus, looks after all the excretion
within us.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:54.000
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds
of things which may not be benevolent for

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.459
ourselves, doesn’t matter.

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:12.959
Kundalini cannot be destroyed - the source
which is going to give you the self-realization,

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.750
I say She is your individual Mother.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:23.710
And this Mother is such a loving Mother and
She knows each and everything about you - from

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:29.250
your past, from your past lives - She knows
you very well.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:37.420
She is just waiting for a chance that She
can be awakened and She can give you your

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.730
second birth.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:44.410
When you were born, your mother suffered for
you – you did not suffer.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.970
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this
kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.160
is all falsehood.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.420
Absolutely falsehood.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.790
And it is so absurd that how can a mother
give you problems?

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:08.670
I mean, I don’t know about some mothers
are funny also – that’s all human problems.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.660
But this is a Divine Mother.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:16.480
She’s not going to give you trouble.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.540
But these problems that have come are coming
from people who have no authority, who have

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.540
no education, who do not know what Kundalini
is.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:33.540
Some say it is in the stomach, some say in
the head, some say in the legs.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:40.220
Those who have no character of their own,
because they have to be pure people themselves,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:46.579
try all kinds of nonsensical tricks and create
problems on the sympathetic nervous system

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:54.430
and they call it as something that it is the
problem of the Kundalini.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.370
Kundalini will never give you any problems.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:04.410
On the contrary, when She rises and when you
get your awakening, the first thing that is

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.410
established is thoughtless awareness.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:18.949
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought
rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:24.259
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:33.300
It makes you stop in the present and you grow
in the present, and the thoughts, if you want

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.899
to think you can think, if you don’t want
to think, it is not like a madhouse going

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:44.209
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop
it.

00:16:44.209 --> 00:16:52.330
This works out with the Kundalini’s awakening
when She crosses this center of ours, which

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.259
we call as Agnya chakra.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.880
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers
about Christ.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:04.470
Let us see what people have to say about Christ
in other shastras and scriptures.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:09.270
Who was He?

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:15.380
Because people did not allow Him to manifest
for more than four years and in four years

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.689
what can you do?

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:20.139
You cannot do anything.

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:26.820
I must tell you in London I came, My husband
was selected for a job and that’s how we

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:33.940
are here, and for four years I was struggling
with seven of them, just struggling.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:39.100
Giving realization was such a difficult subject
to the English people at that time.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.280
They are hard nuts, I know.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.830
But once they break, they are the best.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.790
I think the best are the hardest.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.790
And it worked, it clicked.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:18:02.639
I am surprised that I had to work very hard
but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:07.610
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly
also – a lot of scholarship in them.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:14.419
Found out all about Kundalini, everything
from wherever – your libraries are so well-equipped.

00:18:14.419 --> 00:18:18.600
And I was surprised, it was all there.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.220
They studied Sanskrit.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:27.530
Now can you imagine these people English singing
Sanskrit song with that speed?

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:32.220
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi
when they were in India.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.990
Three hundred years they were there, they
could not speak one sentence you will be surprised.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:42.620
We had to tell them in English how to speak
Hindi.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:49.490
Like you have to say “open the door” – is
in Hindi, is darwaja khol do.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.490
They couldn’t say it.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.480
So we had to say, “there was a banker”
or something like that – means “close

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.909
the door” – “there was a banker.”

00:18:56.909 --> 00:19:00.460
They couldn’t speak Hindi.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.570
Sanskrit is very far off.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.659
And now look at them, what has happened to
them.

00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:12.260
And Indian music is such a difficult music,
you have to really, it is a question of penance,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.340
tremendous penance.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:19.210
Now we have people who play beautiful tabla,
beautiful instruments not only but sing so

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.210
well.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:28.410
Swiss, the hardest nuts you can ever think
of, they are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:37.390
the way they sing, tremendous manifestation
in such a short time.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:43.340
Of course they can also sing English very
well, they know English music very well, or

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.560
should say Western music very well.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.889
But to learn this difficult melodies of India
is remarkable.

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:53.940
I am myself surprised at this.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:01.950
So what happens in the second center when
it enters, you just become dynamic, because

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.780
the second center is for aesthetics and for
creativity.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:16.730
Now we have, like My brother who was a chartered
accountant, he was very bad at all the languages.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.470
Very bad, of course Sanskrit was out of question.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:26.310
Now he is making poetry in Sanskrit and in
Urdu language and also in Marathi, which is

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.310
the most difficult language.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.360
This is the second center.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:37.530
When Kundalini nourishes that center, like
a very beautiful Mother she nourishes.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:45.609
You must have heard about some great artists
– Amjad Ali, he was here – after realization

00:20:45.609 --> 00:20:47.090
he became such a great artist.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.470
There are so many artists.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.379
In India, they understand.

00:20:51.379 --> 00:20:52.960
They want to sing before Me.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.900
I mean I don’t know how to say that now
only one person can sing.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:05.550
Because their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity
becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:14.200
At the same time, that person becomes very
mild, very sweet, very compassionate.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.810
Like there’s one great singer.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.340
She’s a Muslim lady, I will not name her.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.990
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please
allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.109
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:29.169
So she came down.

00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:36.060
And the lady who was playing harmonium – she
came and told Me, “This lady is just an

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:43.500
atom bomb, You don’t know how she gets angry
if there’s one note I play wrong.”

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.359
I saw her but she was very silently playing
– nothing doing, she never got angry with

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:50.359
anyone.

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:54.550
So in the interval, this lady comes and tells
Me, “That see in Your presence, I don’t

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.500
know what has happened to this lady.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.409
This tiger has become like a cow.

00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:02.860
How is it?”

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.270
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:15.609
So this violence, this anger, this temper
is not your creation, it’s the creation

00:22:15.609 --> 00:22:16.810
of your liver.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:28.250
Your liver is little out of order because
of many things, and the temper is there.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.810
Now when the temper is too much, you don’t
know what to do.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.280
I mean you can do whatever you like.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.639
In your temper after all, it’s like a drunken
personality.

00:22:38.639 --> 00:22:43.690
You have to approach a person in a temper
with a barge pole.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.500
But all this temper, everything, becomes so
cool and so beautiful.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.530
It’s very surprising.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:23:00.220
A very dynamic person becomes extremely compassionate,
extremely compassionate, and I’ve had such

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:09.750
beautiful experiences of their compassion
that it’s not easy to describe.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:17.290
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities
which has got a trait like this and a trait

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.450
like that, everything dissolves.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:30.550
Everything dissolves because of this center
which is so creative and which also gives

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:37.500
you the manifestation of pure knowledge - pure
knowledge.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:44.419
For example you start feeling on your finger
tips – you just start feeling on your finger

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:45.419
tips.

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:52.310
Like today only, somebody came and told Me,
“That Mataji my Agnya is catching.”

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:58.470
Agnya is this center - means “I’ve got
my ego on.”

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.609
Will anybody say like that?

00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:04.350
On the contrary if you tell somebody, “You
have got your ego,” they’ll show you that

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.149
they have their ego on.

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:10.240
It’s very dangerous to say to somebody that
your ego is on.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.580
But just because of self knowledge - pure
knowledge - you know that this Mr. Ego is

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:27.100
sitting here and I cannot cross through and
there’s a blockage here, which I have to

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.250
take it out.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.510
It’s so innate within you, everything, only
thing is your connection has to be made.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.720
Once the connection is made, immediately you
know about yourself.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:48.690
And this center which is responsible for creating
all kinds of funny thoughts and horrible creativity

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:54.580
becomes so benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:02.720
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these
people who could not even say one word in

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.610
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit
and this - specially the one they sang, the

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:17.020
first one - many Indians cannot sing that
way I can tell you, they can’t.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.700
It’s not easy.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.060
It’s a very great tongue twister first of
all the language is.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:30.570
Apart from that, to sing in such a correct
pronunciation is so difficult but they have

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.970
done it.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:42.050
So in Sahaja Yoga, an artist who is struggling
today may become a great artist tomorrow.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:46.360
But still I would say these are temptations.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.190
You’ll become a great artist, you’ll start
earning more money, this, that…but that’s

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.590
not the one.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:58.460
You have to really be satisfied with, you
will never be satisfied with that.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:05.760
So you move to the third center which we call
as the Nabhi chakra.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:15.010
This center is, on one side, is made of water
and another side with fire.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:27.139
Around it are our ten valencies, which we
can call as our innate religion within ourselves.

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:39.480
Now this Nabhi itself - or we can call the
solar plexus or we can say the Navel chakra

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:48.720
- gives us, as soon as the Kundalini rises,
she awakens this and the light when it spreads,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.089
you become religious.

00:26:50.089 --> 00:26:55.390
I don’t have to tell you anything, you just
become.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.800
I don’t have to say that you don’t take
drugs.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.350
You just don’t take it.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.490
Overnight I have seen people have given up
drugs.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.590
Overnight, alcoholism.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.679
Overnight, everything.

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:07.429
And they enjoy their virtues.

00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:10.480
That’s the best part of it.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.629
Some people think, well then what is the fun?

00:27:12.629 --> 00:27:21.570
What is this that you take something in the
pub and next day you have hangover.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:26.649
Here you take something and next day you are
much better off.

00:27:26.649 --> 00:27:29.560
It never comes down.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.360
It never gives you a reaction.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.360
It’s not artificial.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.050
It’s not intoxicating.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:39.820
It is from your nerves it’s bubbling out.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:46.620
So this is the center which is very important
in us because most of us have a problem with

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.810
this center.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:28:08.780
And here we have a capacity by this center
that we enjoy our generosity.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:15.629
Now all matter whatever it is - we are materialistic,
materialistic, it is a good idea to be materialistic.

00:28:15.629 --> 00:28:24.200
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters
are, that you can give it to others suggesting

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.400
your love in it.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.550
I think that’s the only thing the matter
can do.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:36.080
And in a very special way you can express
that love.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:44.730
For example, somebody likes a particular thing
- you go all the way to get it and give that

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:56.409
small thing, very small thing, to the person
and the joy, not out of the money that you

00:28:56.409 --> 00:29:06.139
have spent, but the feelings you have expressed
of knowing what that person would love.

00:29:06.139 --> 00:29:14.379
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

00:29:14.379 --> 00:29:21.920
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.740
And you don’t need anything because everybody
is looking after your needs.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:33.430
Now I have told them I love flowers because
I don’t take anything else.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.910
So you must see whenever I come My house is
so filled with flowers that My husband was

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.490
saying, “Let us go live in the garden and
let the flowers be here.”

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:51.880
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this
center.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:30:02.500
And whatever you eat, whatever you have to
eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.929
You don’t have to bother as to what to eat,
what not to eat – you just eat whatever

00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:10.200
is good for you, benevolent for you.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.810
You become so wise and also you please others.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.460
You don’t displease others by saying, “This
is bad food, I want that.”

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.520
’I want’ goes away.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.000
What do you want?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.720
[speaks aside]

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:37.659
So the, like you could say a candle which
is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:41.990
is asking for the light – “I want light.”

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:49.280
But once it is enlightened, it gives light
to others, automatically - supposed to be.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:58.120
In the same way you also start giving your
light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.750
I don’t have to tell you.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.869
Nobody has to go through any Ten Commandments
anymore.

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:06.860
Those days are gone.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:22.300
Now automatically you become like that - very
beautiful people, very affectionate and glorious,

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.300
I should say.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:30.879
If you see the glow on the face of Sahaja
Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:41.070
Many people drop out their ten years to twenty
years in their age and they are so enthusiastic,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:48.809
never get tired, especially in England I’ve
seen – or also in the West I would say everywhere

00:31:48.809 --> 00:31:50.690
– people get very really tired.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.200
On the television also you find people will
come and sit down “huh…”

00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:02.050
Young people, they’ll talk ten times, they’ll
say “huh…

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.420
Why are we so tired?”

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.669
Because we think too much.

00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:15.300
All energy is wasted in thinking, so no energy
left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:22.770
For example, you have to have people for dinner,
they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:28.310
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated
and so nervous about the whole thing – when

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:32.650
the guests come in, they feel like running
away.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.639
Because so much of tension of thinking, thinking,
thinking…..

00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:40.470
Planning, planning, planning, planning, planning…

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.599
Ultimately the whole joy has disappeared.

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:55.480
So the second center which is there, it does
a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:02.130
grey cells in our brain, when we are using
it for thinking, and also it looks after your

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:13.280
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys
and lower part of your abdomen.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.580
Instead of doing that, poor thing is busy
only sending grey cells to your brain because

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.380
thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, like
mad.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:29.480
So you develop all other diseases – liver
trouble, which is very common.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.760
Then you develop diabetes – very common.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.730
Yesterday at least there were ten people who
said we have diabetes.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.389
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking
too much sugar – take it from Me.

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:53.460
In India if you go to a village, you’ll
see that he takes sugar in such a manner that

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.909
in the cup the spoon must stand at right angles,
otherwise he won’t take it.

00:33:58.909 --> 00:34:01.530
But he never gets diabetes.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:08.400
The reason is he doesn’t think of tomorrow
- he just works hard, eats his food and sleeps

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.540
off, nicely.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.940
He doesn’t take sleeping pills either.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:20.909
So this diabetes comes by over-thinking and
can be easily cured if you can take to Sahaja

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:27.619
Yoga, which I’ll tell you how we’ll stop
our thinking at this, I’ve already told

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:30.139
you, at this point.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:35.210
Then the third disease which is even more
dangerous than this, is the disease which

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.640
we call as blood cancer.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.099
Blood cancer is caused only to people who
think too much.

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:49.540
It can even be to the children if the mother
is very meticulous, particular about her carpets

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.899
or her house, everything you know and even
a rat doesn’t enter that house.

00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:59.240
But she is very careful that all her things
are properly done, her sink doesn’t have

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.560
even so much of, little bit of a spot left
in it.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.920
All the time, thinking, planning, thinking,
planning.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.191
This affects the child and a child also can
get blood cancer.

00:35:15.191 --> 00:35:24.540
Blood cancer you get it because your spleen
is a speedometer- is the one which gives you

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.040
the rhythm of life, rhythm of life.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:38.990
Now when we are hectic people, all the time
under shock, then this goes out of order.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:49.700
For example in the morning we get up and see
the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.110
have killed someone – such a shock.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.500
Then an accident, then…

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.810
I mean newspaper will never give good news,
will they?

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:06.660
Will they give news, how many people got realization
or something is working out all, all right?

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:12.880
No something horrible that should shock your
heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.790
you’ll not take it seriously.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:23.620
So, once you read that, you don’t know your
system is a very delicate system, it gets

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.860
a shock.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.970
And then you get into your car, without taking
your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.090
breakfast because you are late.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.270
On the way there is a jam – you are shouting,
screaming - somehow or other you reach the

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:42.600
office and there is the boss barking.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.010
This is how we live, under complete tension.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.890
We are supposed to be free people.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:57.390
In the night if you sing loudly the neighbor
will come and put you to the police station.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.510
I mean you can’t do anything.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.390
There’s no freedom.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.120
You have to be bound by the watch.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.710
This is the time, exact you have to reach
there.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:16.490
So all these things, pressures, and all these
things work on us and we become hectic.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:27.420
And for emergency, this spleen is the one
which releases red blood corpuscles – RBCs.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.920
But if you are all the time like this hectic,
that poor spleen becomes mad.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.840
It doesn’t know what to do.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:43.470
It starts producing more cells, more cells
and then it thinks it’s a mad person I am

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.580
fixed with because I don’t know when to
act, when not to act.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.250
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly
with some other shock, you might get blood

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.930
cancer and then the doctors will certify you
are going to die after one month.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.280
Finished, prepare for your burial.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.290
And the whole house is crying.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:19.570
But we have cured, I mean Sahaja Yoga has
cured blood cancer of many people just by

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:26.990
this Kundalini awakening because as soon as
the Kundalini is awakened, too much movement

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:32.180
this side and that side, this all the time
going on, in the center – this is the left

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.040
and the right side of the sympathetic – so
just the Kundalini passes through, strings

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:44.720
through and brings it back and nourishes it.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.800
The problem is over.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:54.100
And though they were certified to be dead,
after even four years they are all right,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:39:02.980
working all right, the certificate is cancelled.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:11.340
Even vulnerability to cancer, or to all incurable
diseases, are because of these centers going

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:17.550
out of place.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:24.870
Now we have the center which we call here
as the heart center.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:31.850
It controls the left and right, both – so
we have a left and right heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:44.260
As you know that, this sternum bone creates
the antibodies for you.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:49.740
And these antibodies fight your diseases.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:40:00.351
So when this center goes out, this is the
center which sends all the messages to these

00:40:00.351 --> 00:40:03.880
antibodies.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.650
Now this is the center of a mother.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:15.299
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop
breast cancer.

00:40:15.299 --> 00:40:23.870
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is
worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:35.340
her motherhood is challenged and her sense
of security is very disturbed.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:43.190
As a result of that, she gets this problem.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:50.400
Also if you are too much of a thinker, and
you think too much and you’re very, what

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.560
we call the right-sided, the futuristic planner,
I mean people plan it for ten years.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.090
They plan even their deaths, what dress they
are going to wear and where they are going

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:07.320
to be buried, up to that point.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:16.440
All this futuristic planning creates such
tremendous heat in the body because the liver,

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:22.780
which is supposed to absorb all the heat,
is neglected by this center.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:28.190
As a result that heat travels up and you develop
asthma.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:35.150
Now we had yesterday, at least five or six
people who came with asthma.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.820
Asthma is absolutely curable.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.040
But do you know this is the center of a husband,
or of the father.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.980
Now if I am telling you, you should not be
shocked, because later on you’ll find it.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.510
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get
asthma.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.810
Or if your wife is a shrew, you might get
an asthma.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:03.410
Or if you are a very bad father, you might
get an asthma.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:09.610
Or if your father is not kind to you, you
might get an asthma.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:14.930
If you have not forgiven your father, you
might get asthma.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:21.650
Now can you believe it, just forgiving your
father, you can get out of your asthma permanently.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.120
Sahaja Yoga has cured asthma of so many people.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.720
Believe it or not, it works.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:39.040
It looks so funny but our relationships, our
parents we have chosen when we came on this

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.040
Earth.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:46.430
I know they are wrong, they are obstinate,
they’re headstrong, they may be drunkards,

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.900
whatever they are.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.900
But even if you leave them, because so many
people leave the parents, still forgive them

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.900
and forget.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.280
Otherwise you carry the problems with you.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:04.750
The left heart is the place of the mother.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.470
Now if your mother has been hard with you,
if you have had very bad experiences, you

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:14.300
will have problems of the left heart.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.610
Center heart is very important where your
sense of security should be established.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:23.900
You’ll be surprised in the disease called
AIDS, it is the center heart which is out.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:31.370
We have tried to cure, and we cured also 3,
4 people from AIDS, but they have no will-power

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.720
to continue with Sahaja Yoga, they want to
die.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.570
And they have made a big martyrdom out of
it, you see they are martyrs, great martyrs

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.360
of a great principle they have established.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:49.700
It’s impossible to convince to them, that
this is unnatural that you are doing and that

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.590
you should give it up and you should live,
why should you die?

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:58.040
No, we are martyrs for such a big principle
we have established.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.770
To do something out of the way and new is
the modern fashion.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:11.120
Anything - will do something with the hair,
with the nose, with the eyes, with the ears,

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.430
with the clothes.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.619
That’s all you can do.

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:23.850
To such an extent that they do not realize
that whatever is new may not be good for you.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.990
For example, everyday we eat our dinner.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:32.820
Supposing we want to eat the table because
it is new – is it a sensible thing?

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.330
Anything that is new, is not good.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.410
But anything that is old, may not be good
also.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:45.100
So you have to have that wisdom which comes
to you through Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:51.450
There is no other way out - you have to become
the spirit, and you have to see in the light

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.430
of the spirit, what is right and what is wrong.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:45:02.910
So then wecome to this center which is, we
call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.050
petals, looks after the cervical plexus.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:10.850
Now this is a very very important center and
this is the center is for communication.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:15.700
For example, when you talk, you communicate
through your hands.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.750
You shake hands, you touch somebody, and you
can communicate.

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:23.600
Even if you cannot talk, with your hands you
can communicate.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:33.640
Also when we think we are very responsible,
this center goes out.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:40.040
Like some people were traveling by plane - they
were from villages, they did not know what

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.310
was a plane.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:48.570
They were told to take less luggage because
it should not be a weight for the plane.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.380
So they got into the plane and put all of
the luggage on their heads.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:58.250
And they said that “We are trying to reduce
the weight of the plane.”

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:05.880
In the same way, we are also... actually the
One - which is all-pervading power, which

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.210
has created us, created this universe and
has brought us to this level of human beings

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.650
- is doing everything.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:16.810
But we think we are responsible, we have to
do it.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:21.330
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you just
do it, no doubt.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.630
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.460
You just say its happening.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.500
And what a beautiful feeling it is.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:36.030
Then you don’t have blood pressures, you
don’t have headaches, you don’t have tensions

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.760
– no, because we are not doing it.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:46.090
It is just done and you find it’s all done.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:54.300
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve
told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.430
you can control.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.070
If you want you can think or you don’t think.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.650
But in that silence you feel your peace.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:11.210
If there’s too much of crowds, too much
of problems, suddenly you become the witness.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.720
You start seeing everything.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.860
Seeing the problem, what it is.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.370
Unless and until you can see the problem you
cannot solve it.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:25.190
Because you are in the problem, you just get
upset.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:29.090
But if you are out of the problem, you can
see it.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:35.520
And that’s what happens to you when you
become thoughtlessly aware when this center

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.140
opens out.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:45.120
Last but not the least is the center of limbic
area which is very important.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.870
Now I do not know it has been discovered or
not, but it will be very soon discovered,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:58.380
that very strong things like cracks and all
that have got sulfuric acid in it, and that

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:03.790
doesn’t go anywhere in the body, just rushes
into the limbic area.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:11.210
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which
has got all cells here very sensitive to joy

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:12.400
and happiness.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:20.460
But they become numb, so numb that ordinary
music you cannot hear - somebody has to scream

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.590
at you, has to shout at you, he has to jump
on it, otherwise you cannot enjoy.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:31.420
Then it has to be worse and worse and worse
and worse…

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:37.060
I don’t know now with cracks, later on they
might develop something even more poisonous,

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:43.950
because it has to excite this limbic area
which is such an important thing.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:53.660
But as soon as the Kundalini enters into that
area, limbic area, she soothes it and it opens

00:48:53.660 --> 00:49:00.680
- opens like a lotus, thousand petalled lotus.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:10.930
It opens and then the Kundalini emerges out
of your fontanelle bone area and gets connected

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.650
to the all-pervading power.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:16.350
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in
your hands.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.950
You can feel it all over.

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.860
Some people in the beginning who felt cool
breeze, could not believe it – so they closed

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:28.450
doors, everything and sat down to see, still
they were feeling it.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:35.930
But it works, works in the sense that you
get empowered.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:43.440
You become peaceful, you become the witness,
you become the wise and you become empowered

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:50.190
that you can give realizations to others like
this, that you can raise the Kundalini like

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.440
this and you can establish that connection.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.280
You can do it.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.220
And this is what is your right to have it.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.320
This is what will give you meaning.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:09.600
Otherwise so far whatever we have been doing
is very frustrating.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:15.050
Now yesterday I said some questions can be
asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.580
That means you have no questions?

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:53.940
Or there are some questions we can deal with
it for about 5 minutes.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:51:01.110
There’s one there, please..

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:22.620
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi
near Mother?) repeats the question:

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.420
[What is the process by which you one stops
thinking?]

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.690
It’s very simple.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:37.680
When the Kundalini settles down there, what
happens, as I told you, there is Christ – Christ

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:45.840
is awakened and He sucks in these two institutions
which you see there, the yellow and the blue.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:52.750
These are – one is, the blue one is our
conditioning and the yellow one is our ego.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.540
So both these are sucked in like that.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:04.460
These are sucked in because it is said that
He died for our sins, didn’t He?

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.460
He suffered for us.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:10.430
Now also that’s why yesterday I’ve said
are we going to suffer more than Him?

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:12.720
We don’t have to suffer.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.180
Only awaken Him at Agnya.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.270
We are all right, this is the process, it
opens out.

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.290
All right?

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:28.770
That’s why I said you must forgive, because
He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:32.490
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why
we do both the things – one in the front

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:38.380
and one in the back.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.670
Please get up.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:45.480
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.481
Automatically, I’ll tell you how.

00:52:48.481 --> 00:52:52.210
Please, you see like if you have to sprout
a seed you have to just put it in the Mother

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.210
Earth.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:54.210
How do you do it?

00:52:54.210 --> 00:53:00.770
The Mother Earth has got the capacity and
the seed is built-in within it.

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.890
Now it is all built-in within you, all right.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:09.720
And just you are here, I can raise it – anybody
can raise it, those who have got the capacity

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.840
– Sahaja Yogis can raise your Kundalini
also.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:19.060
[Question from the floor, : You talk about
always thinking.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:28.990
You talk about, like, if you think too much,
you can actually create illness and the problems

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:32.610
in your life.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:38.950
How do You organize Your time and Your work
and everything, but You don’t think about

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:39.950
it?]

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.940
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.240
Everything is done by Divine Power.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:55.640
Why should I think – let it think for Me.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.980
You see I travel every day – I sleep at
2 o’clock in the night, get up about 5 o’clock

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.530
in the morning and I travel everywhere.

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:10.590
And I’m now 67 years of age, all right,
so what.

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.690
Divine Power is looking after Me, it’s working
out everything.

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:23.180
I am just moving about nicely enjoying everything.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:34.390
But you have to believe that you can get realization.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:38.950
You need not believe in the Divine Power,
but you just first believe that you can get

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:42.720
realization and you get it and get in connection
with it.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.980
It just works.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.000
It is the subtlest of subtle.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.720
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we
utilize the divine power in our relationships

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.500
and all the problems?]

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:04.170
You see first of all you have to give to others.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:09.520
Unless and until you open one door, all right
that’s Divine Power there.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.660
But unless and until you open other door,
it won’t come in your life.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.280
So you have to open the other door also.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:22.470
There’s where we fail, we want to use Sahaja
Yoga for our own purpose, for our own – my

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:29.660
brother, my sister, my son, all sorts of my,
my, my…

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:34.240
There there’s problem – but open it out.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.210
Everything works out.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:42.390
You must learn to give.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.130
This is free.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:53.340
[Question inaudible]

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:58.350
It is situated on top of the brain where it
is above the brain, and it is covered with,

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:08.310
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because
I don’t want to quarrel with them.

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.010
But there are 1000 nerves which cover it.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:19.910
And when it is enlightened you’ll be surprised,
you’ll see a beautiful lotus opening in

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:35.730
all colors, very very silent flames, and they
are so peace-giving, looks so beautiful.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:44.870
Because when any nerve gets enlightened, the
light of that flame looks like a petal.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.730
It’s very beautiful, it is.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:50.000
But it has to open out.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.500
Just now it is covered by our conditioning
and our ego.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.109
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

00:56:57.109 --> 00:57:02.170
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person
who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:12.990
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is
also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:49.110
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human
being and a realized soul.

00:57:49.110 --> 00:58:26.690
These are the two stages.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.260
[Question inaudible]

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:36.430
You see the thing is that now there are social
conditions which are very bad, people are

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.330
homeless, they are on the streets.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:43.940
Now thinking about it you are not going to
help them, are you?

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:44.940
No.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:49.330
Which is the best way is to empower yourself,
all right?

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:59.050
Now see for example, in the villages of India
where I work, people have given them alcohol,

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:05.240
they have given up all bad habits, they have
become very dynamic, they have become very

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.490
well off, they are living very well.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:17.240
In London, if you want to work, I am sure
you can get a home, no problem.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.850
You see the Asians who have come here, I am
an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:29.290
they are becoming very rich, because they
work very hard, very hard, so those who want

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:30.290
to… in London.

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:32.310
But in India it may not be.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:36.970
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have
improved so much – they have become so dynamic,

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.390
they have become so hopeful of life.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:48.150
But if you just think that life is good for
nothing, let us now drink and be merry then

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.360
it won’t work out.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.200
These homeless and all these conditions are
all such – because it is an artificial condition

00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:02.350
you know, many people have houses but they
don’t want to give it for people to live.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:08.540
Now if those people get transformation, they
won’t behave like that.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.790
You see the whole behavior will change when
the emancipation of the society comes up.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:21.300
But I have seen in the villages of India there’s
a complete transformation.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:27.340
The social conditions are much worse but Indians
are more satisfied people, they are not so

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340
much.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:34.300
Here even, supposing you offer a house, they
will say, “No, I don’t like this house.”

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.930
You offer a job, they’ll say, “I don’t
want this job.”

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:41.280
All these things are there – also too much
of choices.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.040
But if you decide, London is not difficult
place I tell you to work hard and get a house,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.380
not difficult, they can do it.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:54.690
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:59.590
There are so many old people who haven’t
got anybody to help them.

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.020
But these people will never go and help them.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.330
They can earn.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:09.550
This is a place where anybody can earn I think,
because I know people, Asians, who have come

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:15.869
here without any money are very rich today
- all have got big big cars, nice houses,

01:01:15.869 --> 01:01:16.869
this, that.

01:01:16.869 --> 01:01:19.230
You can see that they are very hardworking.

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:24.970
And then divorces, everybody third day if
you divorce someone what will happen to you?

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.060
You’ll end up without a home.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:31.160
No respect for the wife, the wife has no respect
for the house.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.380
All upside down society.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:39.350
There’s a big quarrel going on between husband
and wife – how can you have a home with

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:41.180
this husband and wife fighting?

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.990
Even TV if you open, nothing but fighting
- you just don’t want to hear anyone.

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:52.920
See we had to decide on certain things – that
if we have to make a home, then we have to

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.920
understand our role in life.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:01.440
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal,
no doubt.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.920
But they are like two wheels of a chariot
which has some distance but they are not similar.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.220
And no use fighting with each other – when
you can’t live without each other, why should

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220
you fight?

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.350
And the children are on the streets.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:21.720
Every child I find 18 years of age is out
of the house.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.119
I mean here the little children are killed
– why?

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:29.270
In India, I cannot think of such a thing.

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:38.270
The reason, though they are very poor, the
reason is they know what is love.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:43.609
And that is what I feel that the society has
to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:49.500
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga
– I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.750
They have beautiful children, they are living
very well, they have good houses.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:59.290
Those who were really hippies had nothing,
are having nice houses and everything they

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.960
have.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:08.630
Also some of them, were “Oh, so I am now
fortunately, I am without job.”

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.810
And I said, “What, you are very fortunate?”

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.119
“Yea, now I am without job.

01:03:14.119 --> 01:03:16.609
Very happy about it.”

01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:22.619
So I told the gentleman that if you are not
going to stick to one job, you are not going

01:03:22.619 --> 01:03:25.790
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:34.770
And that fellow today has a big car, a nice
wife, children and a house.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:43.600
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must
be given up.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.090
One has to come to a balance and value your
life.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:51.520
You must value it.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.230
Human life is very valuable.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:04:09.960
With what great difficulty God has created
you and what are we doing with it?

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:18.840
The whole society has to take a turn and think
of living happily – if the husband and wife,

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:27.720
I mean such a relationship, husband and wife
cannot live together, then how do we expect

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.240
this world to have United Nations?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.920
We cannot – it is falsehood.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:47.950
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we
have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:53.070
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand
– fallen in love, now they are rising in

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.869
love, falling in love again, again falling,
rising in love again… how many times they

01:04:56.869 --> 01:04:58.600
fall in love God only knows.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.130
It’s a funny stuff going on.

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:09.350
We have to face the reality.

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:14.369
So just worrying about these things, what
we should do, is to first of all become wise

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.180
and understand the problems.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.950
We can all solve it.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:24.830
It is very simple, it is very simple to solve
the problems.

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:30.170
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:37.090
And secondly, that it solves your problems.

01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:42.599
Just worrying about poor people, it’s also
a kind of a fashion these days.

01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:45.490
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met
a lady.

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:47.470
She said, “I am very guilty.”

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.470
I said, “Why?”

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:49.470
“Because of Afghanistan.”

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.470
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:53.160
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.500
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.500
“Nothing.”

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:03.140
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing
about it?

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:18.130
But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi finds
out ways and methods of creating a convenient

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:23.920
life – a life where you can earn, you can
live… we do it – we have done, I have

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.520
so many examples.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.710
Because it’s a collective life also you
help each other.

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:40.440
We didn’t have rich people in Sahaja Yoga
many because they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.300
They go to false gurus because they can purchase
the guru – they can’t purchase Me.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.170
So mostly the rich never come here.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:53.140
Bureaucrats also don’t come, politicians
don’t come.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:59.490
So those people who come to Me are the people
who can easily solve the problem because they

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:07.810
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:16.930
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My
husband was not so for it – everybody said,

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.120
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:27.960
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey,
and a woman, I just said I must go.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.532
But I was surprised, they worshipped Mother,
they worshipped their mothers.

01:07:32.532 --> 01:07:36.650
And they were so beautiful – so many.

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:42.250
In one shot, we got 70 people – serious
Sahaja Yogis.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:48.000
But do you know when I reached there, people
from America, from Australia, from all over

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.670
the world arrived there in Turkey to help
Me.

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:58.920
I mean I was so enamored to see My children
coming, arriving there on their own - those

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.140
who could afford it.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.960
And the Turkish people were so beautiful,
I tell you.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:09.000
I found they are the same everywhere.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.750
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell
you, otherwise we are just the same.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:32.000
So all these problems can be easily solved
– there’s nothing so serious about it.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:09:00.650
There is 

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:16.270
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and
until you are connected, it is like telephoning

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:19.350
without connection.

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:28.040
There are people in India who’ll go on saying
“Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama” like that.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.859
And the chakra of Rama itself will be caught.

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:37.460
They’ll be saying “Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva”
and the heart chakra, where Shiva resides,

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.549
it will be caught.

01:09:39.549 --> 01:09:49.960
The reason is, supposing you want to meet
the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.130
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested!

01:09:55.130 --> 01:10:05.400
And you’ll end up in a jail!

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:15.480
So you must have some connection, there should
be some protocol.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.930
Now if it is for kings and prime ministers,
what about God?

01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:26.860
He’s not in your pocket.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.230
But once you are realized, even once you take
the name, it is sufficient.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.790
What is there?

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:35.030
He’s at your disposal all the time there.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:37.770
But you have to have connection.

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:43.730
Now you are the citizens say of England, or
some place, all right so your government is

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:44.820
looking after you.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.100
Whether you are satisfied or not is not the
point.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.050
But they are looking after you.

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:57.670
But if you enter into the Kingdom of God,
then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:05.500
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things
work out.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:41.920
So amazing 

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.510
it is, so amazing.

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:53.190
See first of all they say Kundalini has to
rise.

01:11:53.190 --> 01:12:00.460
Then it sometimes comes back to the centers
which are needing more help.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:08.460
So it is like a rope you can say, which has
many strings in it, very thin ones just like

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:13.780
a hair, and one by one they open out.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:22.500
So first, very few of them pierce through,
open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.120
and the chakras open out more.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.690
It goes on like that.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:35.360
But once you are connected properly then there’s
no problem.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.840
But it is instantaneous, no doubt about it.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.360
But for that you have to come to our centers,
don’t have to pay anything, just spend some

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:52.950
time and you have to master it, that’s all.

01:12:52.950 --> 01:13:01.470
There’s a question, what purpose do we have
on this planet?

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:15.790
The purpose of our existence is to prove that
God’s creation is the most successful thing.

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:20.320
That’s the purpose.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:41.969
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry.

01:13:41.969 --> 01:13:47.020
You better get your realization and try to
find out about Me, because those who have

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.989
talked - you see human beings are mad people,
you don’t know.

01:13:50.989 --> 01:13:55.750
Christ said “I am the Son of God” – which
He was no doubt.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:14:00.920
And He saidthat, “I am the door” – which
He was, no doubt.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.130
But they crucified Him.

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:05.350
They gave poison to Mohammed Sahib.

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:07.650
They killed so many saints.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:12.860
I know human beings very well, so please I
am not going to talk to you about Myself at

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.920
all.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:19.239
You better get your self-realization - try
to know Me.

01:14:19.239 --> 01:14:27.740
Because I have to do some jobs, all right
and for that, I want to live.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:31.250
People are really sometimes so funny.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:36.880
Even otherwise they behave in such a funny
manner that I can’t understand.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.460
As if I am going to take away their property
or something.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:48.460
I am here to give you something that is very
important.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:15:08.940
Sort of you can say I am here to complete
the work of Christ, Mohammed and all of them.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:25.830
Yes please….

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:37.050
When you will give to others, you will receive
the blessings.

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:40.610
That’s what it is absolutely 100%.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.610
He said so many things.

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:51.070
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout
I think.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:16:01.860
[Question inaudible]

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:15.820
That 

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.930
should not be the question just now, all right.

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.940
Because to say anything about it, you know
what happens with people.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:30.070
So this can be discussed later on, when we
get our self-realization.

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:37.410
Certain things at a level can be discussed
and this is what happened with all of them

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:43.150
because they had very little time to talk
to you.

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:54.040
And that’s why everything has been misinterpreted,
misused, because to understand the truth,

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.960
to bear it also, one has to have self-realization.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.700
This I have found out.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:07.710
If you are not a self realized person you
can’t bear the truth, you cannot – it’s

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:20.780
too much for human mind to grasp and to allow
it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.100
Truth is too much for them.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.820
So the first thing should be that we get our
self-realization.

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.620
Yes, my child…

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:31.420
[Initial question inaudible.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:37.060
Mother: Can you get up, please?

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:43.590
Questioner: Yes, of course

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:48.489
Mother: Thank you.

01:17:48.489 --> 01:18:01.180
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change
all the time?[…

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.750
INAUDIBLE]

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.980
But the auras you see sometimes are these
colors only.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:11.250
But sometimes you are more strong with one
center, so that color shows.

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:18.239
They do not change, they are just the same.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:22.940
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so
we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:29.620
us finish with our self-realization which
is going to take only 10 minutes.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:35.580
Those who do not want to have should please
leave, they should not sit here and just watch

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.680
other people.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:43.160
That’s the only kindness I request of them
– that if you do not want to have self-realization,

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.610
it’s better that you should leave.

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:52.120
Those people who are standing, could not get
place, can come here or you can also give

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.230
them places if you want to give some places.

01:18:56.230 --> 01:19:01.460
No, not for Sahaja Yogis, I said for others
– for others, for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.620
can stand up.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:45.740
At the very outset you have to now understand
that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:56.389
of God and hence we have to little bit unload
ourselves.

01:19:56.389 --> 01:20:09.650
One of the conditions is that we should not
feel guilty – one should not feel guilty

01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:10.650
at all.

01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:14.200
Yesterday, same problem I said, but you were
still feeling guilty.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.750
Also it’s a fashion.

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.200
Also I think the language is such – all
the time sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry…

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:25.040
Even when we used to receive telephones we
used to say “I beg your pardon.”

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.700
But now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten
times sorry.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:33.000
What is there to be so sorry?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.920
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards
ourselves.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.710
We have to respect ourselves.

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.790
We have to be happy about ourselves.

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:48.520
This is first thing is not to feel guilty
about anything - just believe that you have

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:55.650
done nothing wrong which cannot be dissolved
by this great power of forgiveness.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:59.240
Please believe Me.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:05.440
But if you want to stick onto a feeling like
that – “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.590
only mental.

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:14.090
Animals don’t feel guilty about anything
– a dog will bark, tiger will eat anything

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:15.710
that it wants to.

01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:20.090
It’s only human beings who feel that way
– that I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:21.090
that wrong.

01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:26.400
All right, so not to feel guilty that’s
one point.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:37.920
The second one is to forgive everyone, which
is very difficult for many people.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:45.170
I don’t know how many mounds of unhappiness
is in the head because we cannot forgive.

01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:50.280
Mounds, it’s not kilos and kilos.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:59.050
Yesterday I found most of them had not forgiven
and I had to go on putting balm on their heads

01:21:59.050 --> 01:22:00.770
to take out.

01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:03.460
So you must cooperate.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:08.040
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.050
First of all forgive yourself and forgive
everyone.

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:17.570
And be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:20.710
There’s no Greek tragedy going on here – no
tragedy.

01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:31.410
We are in a very beautiful atmosphere and
we are going to go into the most beautiful

01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:35.300
area within ourselves, that is our spirit.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:40.520
So we have to be very light about it.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:49.830
All right, with all this understanding, I
have to request you that we have to take out

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:57.199
your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us a lot.

01:22:57.199 --> 01:23:17.910
And not to be serious – not to be serious
about it.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:31.730
It’s not frivolous, but it’s fun.

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:50.000
So you have to put your left hand towards
Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.690
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down
it would be very nice.

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.980
Please be seated and don’t move about.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:06.250
Left hand towards Me like that – be comfortable,
if you want you can put it on your lap or

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.230
you can put it up if you want to.

01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:21.210
Then the right hand needs to be used for nourishing
your centers on the left-hand side.

01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:25.530
Now I’ll show you how we’ll be nourishing.

01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:30.090
Before that, please remember that put your
both the feet apart from each other – not

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:33.960
too much, but slightly.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.080
Now, left hand towards Me.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:47.350
I’ll show you before and then we can close
our eyes and work it out.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:25:00.190
Put your right hand on your heart – in the
heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:08.420
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi
Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:13.449
reflection of God Almighty.

01:25:13.449 --> 01:25:21.270
So we put our attention to our heart first.

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:29.250
Then we take our right hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen on the left-hand side and press

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.560
it hard.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.920
This is the center of our mastery.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:43.960
We take down our right hand on the lower portion
of our abdomen and press it hard.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:55.480
This is the center of pure knowledge that
manifests on our central nervous system.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:05.150
We take back our hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen.

01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:14.050
And again we take it in the heart, in the
upper portion of our heart.

01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:23.081
Then we take it in the corner of our neck
and our shoulder and put your head to the

01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:25.760
right.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:34.820
This is the center we catch when we feel guilty.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:49.480
Then we take our hand on our forehead and
slowly bring down our head on it to rest.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:27:00.590
Here we press it on both the sides and this
is the center to forgive.

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:14.400
We take back our hand on the back side of
our head and put our head resting on it - this

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.250
is the center for asking forgiveness without
feeling guilty.

01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:30.520
We stretch our hand, with the center of our
palm, we put it on our head in the soft bone

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:39.290
area of our childhood, called as fontanelle
bone area, and slowly we put down our head.

01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:54.420
Here we stretch our fingers and move our scalp
carefully with pressure, slowly, clockwise,

01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:00.380
seven times.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:18.920
That’s all we have to do.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:27.560
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them until I ask you to open because attention

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.320
has to go inside.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.050
Put your left hand towards Me.

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:37.260
Now first you will feel thoughtless – so
don’t fight with your thoughts.

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.440
Automatically everything will work out.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:47.670
Don’t fight with your thoughts, just keep
watching and ultimately you will feel cool

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:52.680
breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone
area and you’ll also start feeling cool

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:59.200
breeze all around you which is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze of the

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:09.400
all-pervading power as described by Adi Shankaracharya,
Salilam, salilam – it’s cool, and cool.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:22.420
So now, we put our left hand this way towards
Me and the right hand on the heart.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:31.800
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental
question, three times – “Mother, am I

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.500
the Spirit?”

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:42.500
In your heart, ask the question “Mother,
am I the Spirit?”

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:54.120
If you are the spirit you are your master,
because in the light of your spirit you know

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.730
what is right and what is wrong – you can
guide yourself.

01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:05.510
So put your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:16.300
here please ask Me a question again three
times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:25.800
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:36.760
As I have told you that I will not cross your
freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:46.640
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge
on yourself, otherwise I cannot.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:54.560
So please put your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen and ask the question,

01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:09.290
“Mother” - or you can request “Mother
please give me pure knowledge.”

01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:17.560
Say this six times because this center has
got six petals.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:29.830
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:42.110
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints
and seers have built up for us a center of

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:44.300
mastery.

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:54.840
But to open the center we have to have all
the confidence, so please raise your hand

01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:06.469
and put it in the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left-hand side and say with full confidence

01:32:06.469 --> 01:32:19.810
to nourish this center, ten times, “Mother,
I am my own master.”

01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:32.680
Please say this ten times.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:46.090
Now we have to know that we are not this body,
we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:50.900
we are not this intellect.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:55.710
We are not our conditionings or are we our
ego.

01:32:55.710 --> 01:33:00.160
We are pure spirit.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:09.760
So now raise your hand to your heart and with
full confidence say twelve times “Mother,

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.830
I am the spirit.”

01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:21.710
Please say twelve times, “Mother, I am the
spirit.”

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:35.550
You have to know that this Divine Power is
the ocean of love and compassion.

01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:46.390
It is the ocean of joy and bliss but above
all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so there

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:55.469
is no mistake that you have committed which
cannot be dissolved by this ocean.

01:33:55.469 --> 01:34:05.640
So please forgive yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.840
and turn your head to your right.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:24.540
Here you have to say with complete confidence
again, “Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.540
all.”

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:44.120
Or you can call Me Mother – “Mother, I
am not guilty at all.”

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:59.560
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:12.800
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.980
– it’s a myth.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:19.730
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands.

01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:31.490
So put your right hand on your forehead and
please bend your head, resting on the hand

01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:37.660
as much as you can and now press it on both
the sides.

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:46.380
And here please, please, say it from your
heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:55.239
Please say it from your heart - please say
it, otherwise again I will have to work very

01:35:55.239 --> 01:35:56.280
hard on you.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:01.380
So please say it from your heart – “Mother,
I forgive everyone.”

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:08.670
You are not going to miss your self-realization
for not forgiving, please.

01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:24.380
How many lives you have been seeking the truth
that this time you are not going to miss it

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.380
out.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:37:18.820
Now take back your hand on the back side of
your head and push back 

01:37:18.820 --> 01:39:24.980
your head as much as you can resting on 
your 

01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:55.390
hand 

01:39:55.390 --> 01:40:19.070
and here for your own satisfaction, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:37.750
please say, “Oh Divine, if 

01:40:37.750 --> 01:41:10.160
I 

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:35.239
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

01:41:35.239 --> 01:41:53.960
TAPE ENDS

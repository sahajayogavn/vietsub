00:00:28.699 --> 00:01:02.559
Yesterday, you have been explained about the
subtle being within us, a subtle instrument

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:12.860
within us, described in the Bible as Tree
of Life, working out this last breakthrough

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:21.659
of Self-realization.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:34.389
And this happening is a living happening,
a spontaneous happening, the way a seed sprouts

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:44.270
spontaneously when it is embedded in the Mother
Earth.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:59.549
The problem with the human mind is such that
he thinks or it thinks that it can work out

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:12.349
its own realization, its own emancipation.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:22.480
We do not understand a simple thing that at
the human level, we do not do anything that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.130
is living.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.120
We cannot germinate a seed even on that.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.450
We cannot even create anything that is dead.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.510
We can just transform one dead into another
form.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:01.629
But we cannot understand that whatever we
may try, we cannot lay our hands on the living

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.290
process.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.640
Only after Self-realization you are entitled.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.980
You get powers to do living work.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:28.209
That is the sign of a person who is born again,
who is a yogi, who has had a union with the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.209
Divine.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:40.769
It is not those who proclaim or announce or
advertise that we are something special selected

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:52.659
people that we have the powers or that we
can take you to Divine.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.829
One can really produce results.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:09.230
Results can only be produced of living process
when you have the power of your spirit.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:22.070
We have heard about Christ who cured people
and He cured at that time -- in such a short

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.270
time as it was hardly about twenty-one people
â€' and He was crucified.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.190
We could not bear the truth that He was the
Son of God.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.170
Now, maybe one may create big huge organizations
in His name, make big money in His name and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.710
do all kinds of things, but when He was there,
He was present, they denied Him.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:07.420
So as we see within ourself there is this
power which has to manifest, we should be

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.840
very anxious to get our Self-realization.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.900
If I say there is a diamond available here
-- just free, it's your own â€' people

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.730
would come not only from San Diego but also
from Australia, India, Japan and all over

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.200
the world asking for it.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.890
But when I say, "There is this diamond within
you in your heart," still we are identifying

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:44.590
with so many falsehoods that we do not want
that diamond to shine in our attention.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.450
It is a surprise.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:57.120
But I am not surprised because we are still
ignorant.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.270
We do not know how beautifully we are made,
how in our evolutionary process we are built

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.440
in so beautifully -- the whole information
about the truth.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.690
Only this machinery has to work out.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:20.520
Only this has to get connected with the Divine.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:35.580
If we really logically, intelligently understand
that the living process has to work spontaneously

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:45.000
and you can't do anything about it, you can
understand how Sahaja Yoga works.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.380
It's all there.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.920
One does not have to do anything.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.280
It's all there, like a little seed.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.240
A minutest one maybe has all the maps of all
the trees you'll be able to produce.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:08.410
In the same way, within you lies this potential
which is to be manifested.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:19.150
We have been also told about the left and
right side within us.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:26.180
Left and right side are the only two sides
to which our attention can go, which represents

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.020
our sympathetic nervous system.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.220
That is when you go into any emergency.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:39.340
Suppose you are rushing somewhere or running,
your sympathetic goes into action and creates

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.580
the results necessary for that action.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:53.270
For example, you have to run; so the sympathetic
will start pumping the blood fast, will start

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.250
breathing fast.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:05.930
But what brings it back to normal is the central
path, what we call represented in the medical

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.710
terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:16.590
So in our own effort we can only go to the
left or right.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:24.670
But when we try to go too much to the left
or right, we create problems, which we cannot

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.810
explain and we cannot understand.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.419
The first and foremost problem we create is
the physical problem.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.209
Today there are so many diseases.

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:47.220
We cannot understand how these diseases came
into being and what is the nature of its creation

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.680
or how are we going to get rid of this.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:59.800
Everybody is afraid of that unknown disease
and these unknown diseases can fall up to

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:08.770
anyone, whatever you may say, unless and until
you become a spirit.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.800
How they are caused is a very simple thing
to understand.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.460
The physical problems come to us because of
our imbalances.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.020
In various ways we try to go to the left or
to the right.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:33.320
Now, let us see how cancer is caused because
that is the headache of today, or maybe of

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:39.270
yesterday -- today's headache is something
else.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:51.000
Cancer is caused only because we do not keep
to our temperament right.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:02.580
If I say that this is the center that is formed
by the left and the right side, then this

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:11.870
center is providing the necessary vital energy
to the left and right side equally.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:21.380
But supposing you are a very futuristic person,
you are planning too much, thinking too much,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.590
then what do you do?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.930
You use your right side too much.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.010
As a result this moves this way.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:37.060
Also, the center now constricts.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:44.740
There is no space in between left in the center
for the vital energy to flow.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:53.570
At this juncture when you have moved too much
from the left side, if any emotional disturbance

00:10:53.570 --> 00:11:03.630
comes in or if you go to somebody who is practicing
black magic and all kinds of left-sided negative

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:14.170
things, or else you might get weak with an
accident or a shock, this breaks, and when

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:24.840
this center breaks, you lose your connection
with the center.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:31.780
The controlling agency that is the central
nervous system does not play any more part.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:41.820
What happens to you is that the growth of
the cells become malignant -- means they grow

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.410
on their own.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.342
There is no relationship to the growth of
other cells.

00:11:47.342 --> 00:11:55.000
For example, suddenly you'll find such a person
will have a nose increasing in size or you'll

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.140
find an ear increasing in size overpowering
all others or we can say that it becomes a

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.370
very dominating cell.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:08.480
This is a simple thing that happens in cancer.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:17.960
Luckily, we have now in Delhi University the
understanding of Sahaja Yoga very well because

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:26.400
we have cured many people of very -- somehow
they were very highly placed in life of cancer

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.780
and other diseases.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:36.800
So they have accepted it for a doctorate,
and two doctors have got now their MD in two

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.470
subjects -- one was a psychosomatic disease.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.070
One of the psychosomatic disease is cancer.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:52.710
There are so many others -- and another one
who has got his doctorate is in the physical

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:59.839
fitness and vulnerability.

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:04.980
Now there are seven other doctors in London
who are doing research on it (AIDS?) ....and

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:12.500
its remarkable how after realization you get
out of the clutches of physical sickness.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:22.730
So what happens when the kundalini rises,
what she does, she pierces through this constricted

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:30.750
chakras, repairs it and brings it back to
its normal position, repairs it.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:39.770
And I have seen our President of India getting
cured of his cancer in ten minutes time, that

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:44.750
too on the aeroplane.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:53.830
But it's easy to deal with an Indian because
they know what is a kundalini and they know

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.090
what is a saint.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:01.400
They will not easily take to these fake persons.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:14.620
Though you are great seekers of a very high
quality, that understanding is there in India

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.740
more because they know more about the roots
and not about the tree, as you know more about

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.350
the tree.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:31.140
But it's such a barrier in understanding that
three hundred years English ruled in India,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.670
they could not learn a word.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:44.080
Today, it's amazing to see such a difficult
Sanskrit verses about the Primordial Mother

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:53.700
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth
century, which many Indians will find it difficult

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.630
to sing, it's so beautifully sung.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:07.950
The whole mantras, as they say, are beautifully
rendered that even a well-equipped Brahmin

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.440
cannot do, by people who are not from India.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.740
They don't even know Sanskrit language.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:23.060
How this has happened is the manifestation
of the spirit.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:30.060
The manifestation of the spirit gives you
a dynamic personality.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.070
This dynamism comes to you.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.390
You can sing whatever you like, you can draw
whatever you like, you can paint whatever

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.870
you like.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:48.140
There are so many people who have become great
orators and musicians, especially in India,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.750
because my work mostly has been in India.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:58.350
Of course, not that I am not concerned about
the West.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.649
I have been, as I told you, many a times in
America.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:14.540
But to understand the reality, the first thing
we must know that money has nothing to do

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.070
with the living process.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:28.040
In America, you'll be surprised, there has
been a business offered to me that the cool

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:39.020
breeze that I blow, if I can bottle it up,
they can sell it.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:47.590
Everything goes into a business proposition,
and that's why it is so difficult.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:57.450
For example, you have seen near -- of course,
I must say you are great people that you have

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:07.120
come to a program which has nothing to do
with money -- it is something really remarkable,

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.240
I must say.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:17.000
But today if I was talking in India or if
I was visiting even a small village, there

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.100
would have been minimum ten thousand people
-- minimum â€' and they would get all their

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.750
realization.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:42.090
The seeking is in the West, they are honest
seekers, but what to seek is the knowledge

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.960
which is in the East.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:51.200
It's something like somebody have the teeth
but no food, and those have food have no teeth

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:59.990
on one side and on the other side they have
teeth but no food.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:09.169
It is such a simple thing to get rid of your
physical problems â€' is the easiest â€'

00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:18.249
and the second comes is the problem, as they
say, is of stress, which is a common disease

00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:20.879
in the West, is stress.

00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:26.279
What is the source of stress within us?

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:33.919
The source of stress is very simple that when
we think -- I mean, these days the amount

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:45.320
of thinking we do -- first of all when I came
to America, I was very confused because of

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.779
the choices you had.

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:55.159
You walk into any bathroom -- you better ask
the owner how do you operate, otherwise suddenly

00:18:55.159 --> 00:19:01.619
you'll find you have fallen into a big swimming
pool; suddenly it opens out for you.

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:13.639
Or maybe you open some sort of a shower and
it becomes a torrential rain -- so many choices

00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:17.429
which maddens you completely.

00:19:17.429 --> 00:19:22.590
What is there to choose about how you'll have
your scissors?

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:28.179
As long as the scissor work, it should be
all right.

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:33.710
It is so complicated because so much of machinery
-- they have to produce so many things, so

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.909
many varieties!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:44.249
Right from A to Z, whether it is a dress,
whether it is a hair-do, whether it is a carpet,

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:52.519
or it is an ordinary thing which we call as
the handle of the car.

00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:57.989
Before getting into the car better ask the
driver how it operates otherwise you'll be

00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:59.289
lumped?[locked].

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:08.379
There is no uniformity kept about these useless
material things and so the choices are so

00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:09.379
many.

00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:14.460
You go to a shop, you go mad -- you don't
know what to buy.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.900
You just ask them, "I just need a, some, say,
powder for my body."

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.080
"Now, which one you want?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080
This one?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080
This one?"

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.250
They'll give you thirty-two things.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.889
You start wondering, "Oh, God!

00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:32.309
I have only one body and thirty-two things."

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:41.220
It is so difficult to locate something that
you need because you really don't know -- this

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.820
is natural, number one; this is absurd, number
two -- like that goes on and on and on, the

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.450
list for a small nonsensical thing like that.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.200
Then tomorrow you go in the market, you find
that's gone out of market.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.590
Now another thirty-two things have come!

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:09.559
All such maddening things put you to thinking,
"What should I do?"

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:14.850
Then we have to plan out everything in the
future.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:22.419
It is so much so that by temperament, people
have become futuristic.

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:28.119
Like they are sitting here listening to Me,
but they are thinking, "Now, how will I go

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.119
home?

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:31.549
And what food I will be eating?

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:33.799
Then what music I will have?"

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:42.609
They are sitting here at present but thinking
about something ....They are too much planning.

00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:45.249
They do not know the plan of the Divine.

00:21:45.249 --> 00:21:50.840
They'll plan it out: rush, go forward, do
this, go to the airport.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.850
What has happened?

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.860
The plane is delayed three hours!

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.860
Why?

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.600
Because their condition, holiday cancelled.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.429
They had planned the holiday a year ahead.

00:22:04.429 --> 00:22:10.159
Poor things, you see, packed everything to
go somewhere.

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:14.470
Holiday had to be cancelled because the planes
are not moving.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.909
So they sit down on the airport.

00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:19.889
See, they're waiting for something to happen.

00:22:19.889 --> 00:22:25.869
Nothing happens; they go off.

00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:31.600
But a yogi does not plan.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.549
He knows what's going to happen.

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:37.779
He does not bother.

00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:43.380
But supposing a yogi gets lost on the way.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:49.639
Then he thinks, "All right, if I am lost there
must be something here.

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:51.259
I must see it.

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:52.480
I am there with myself.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.909
I am not lost.

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:56.389
So let's enjoy."

00:22:56.389 --> 00:23:00.120
After all, what are we going to miss?

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:07.289
It is something one has to see that as we
are so much stressed and under the domination

00:23:07.289 --> 00:23:17.399
of these watches, that we all the time rush,
rush, rush.

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:22.970
Even the jobs that we do, we are supposed
to rush.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:32.409
You will rush as much as you like but the
problem is your mind also rushes with it and

00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:35.330
the whole personality gets involved into it.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:44.239
But if you have seen a wheel, the whole wheel
moves but the axis has to be steady.

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:49.470
If the axis also starts moving, there is stress.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:59.609
That's exactly what happens to us that we
start moving with all the tensions that are

00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:03.070
so-called -- I call them [unclear].

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.989
There is a center within us which we call
as Swadhisthana center.

00:24:06.989 --> 00:24:14.440
It's the second center which as you see is
working out the Void.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:22.620
We call this as the Void -- not the Zen Void
-- but this is the Void, and this area is

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:32.179
worked out by the Swadhisthana which looks
after the liver, the pancreas, spleen, the

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:35.820
kidneys and part of the intestine.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:43.049
Intestines, physically or in the medical terminology
we can say, the aortic plexus manifested by

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:48.470
this center works out.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:54.929
Now when the center is doing this work in
balance, it's all right.

00:24:54.929 --> 00:25:05.759
But when we think too much then the same center
has to convert the fat for the use of the

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:11.509
brain to make it into gray cells.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:21.450
But when we think too much then it neglects
other important works which it has to do.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.139
So you get a liver trouble.

00:25:24.139 --> 00:25:33.269
I find at least fifty percent people in the
West are suffering from liver trouble.

00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:39.799
They are not aware of it till they get to
cirrhosis, to skin troubles, this, that.

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:48.779
They will not know that they have a bad liver,
till they have jaundice or other diseases

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:55.669
which are caused by liver problems.

00:25:55.669 --> 00:26:00.389
Then we have people who have lethargic livers
also.

00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:06.570
So we have two types of people who have lethargic
organs or overactive organs.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:17.929
So this Swadhisthana Chakra cannot look after
its duty in a balanced way, creates a kind

00:26:17.929 --> 00:26:21.149
of an imbalance.

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:28.350
So you neglect your pancreas, you get diabetes.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:35.989
It's a funny idea that is now prevalent that
we should not take sugar because â€' I

00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:41.479
don't know from where it has come -- because
they think it causes you diabetes!

00:26:41.479 --> 00:26:44.720
It does not.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:56.820
In India, in a village if you go, they have
to put so much sugar in the tea that the spoon

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:03.850
must stand at right angles â€' otherwise
they won't take â€' and nobody has diabetes.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.250
They have never heard about it, never.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.250
No.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.889
"What is diabetes?

00:27:08.889 --> 00:27:10.759
What is that?"

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.529
they'll say.

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:19.249
The reason is they don't think.

00:27:19.249 --> 00:27:20.249
They live for the moment.

00:27:20.249 --> 00:27:22.999
All right, today is the work.

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:30.100
Let's do this farming and come home and sleep
off.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.460
They don't think too much.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.960
We think about everything, plan out everything.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:43.830
Whatever is spontaneous also we think about
it!

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.769
Then the third thing that happens to you is
the trouble of the spleen.

00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:50.619
Now spleen is our time-keeper.

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:53.789
It gives us a rhythm.

00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:59.070
As you have seen the rhythm today, in the
same way it's the rhythm of the life is kept

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.470
by the spleen.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:08.849
When you go into an emergency, then the same
spleen starts producing more red blood corpuscles

00:28:08.849 --> 00:28:10.620
for your use.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:17.789
Now today's life, as it is, is all the time
shocking.

00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:23.609
Early in the morning you read your newspaper.

00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:30.480
I think this is one of the worst habits, because
as soon as you see the newspaper, the first

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.789
shock in the morning.

00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:32.989
Oh, God!

00:28:32.989 --> 00:28:34.349
So many dead.

00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:36.960
Plane was crashed.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.610
War has started.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.909
Somebody fell from somewhere.

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:47.460
All horrible things in the newspaper because
newspapers don't believe in giving something

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.429
good news!

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:56.679
If there will be peace and happiness what
will they publish, I don't know.

00:28:56.679 --> 00:29:01.710
So they want to give shocking news so there
is some sensation in the body.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:08.099
It has happened to such an extent that now
unless and until the music is sensational,

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:14.659
unless and until we get a shock all the time,
we do not react.

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:18.999
Of course, the joy part is missing -- no doubt
about it.

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:27.330
So this poor spleen doesn't understand -- this
personality which is all the time under shock.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:33.369
Then you get into our car and on the road
there is a jam.

00:29:33.369 --> 00:29:34.369
Finish!

00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:38.749
You had to reach at such and such time; now
it's a jam.

00:29:38.749 --> 00:29:45.659
Now you are cursing everything, sitting down
there worrying.

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:47.529
Suddenly you find an accident.

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:51.690
Then you go in the office or some place where
you are working.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:57.059
The boss has had a quarrel with his wife;
so he comes and shouts at you -- another shock.

00:29:57.059 --> 00:30:03.480
All the time you are facing very arrogant,
horrible people.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:09.249
I mean, I myself am afraid to go to shops
or anything because suddenly they jump on

00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:14.970
you like a horse or sometimes like a dog.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.599
God knows how they will react on you.

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:19.419
You get a fright.

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:20.970
What's the matter with them?

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.340
Why are they so shocking?

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:29.379
But all of them are under stress and they
are taking it out on you.

00:30:29.379 --> 00:30:39.840
But the worst thing that happens with this
spleen going crazy is that you get blood cancer.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:51.369
Blood cancer is caused by hectic life and
for speedy life that we lead.

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:55.259
Now the blood pressure comes from the kidney.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:31:00.590
And like that so many things are caused by
one simple thing â€' that we think too

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.140
much.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.950
What is there to think?

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.820
I just don't understand.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.599
Whatever has to happen, will happen.

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:15.090
By thinking, nothing is going to stop.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.190
By thinking we have achieved nothing.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:26.049
If you read Einstein who has developed the
theory of relativity, at the very outset he

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:34.929
says that, "I was tired and I was lying down
in my garden, playing with soap bubbles and

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:43.080
suddenly from somewhere unknown the theory
of relativity dawned upon me."

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.240
Whatever we have is there.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:54.469
Whatever we have to find out comes from the
unknown, but thinking about it like mad just

00:31:54.469 --> 00:31:55.469
ruins us.

00:31:55.469 --> 00:31:57.990
But if I say, "Don't think," you can't stop
thinking.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:03.159
I know that because we had a wonderful doctor
in Switzerland.

00:32:03.159 --> 00:32:05.580
He came and said, "Mother, do what You like.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:10.049
You cut my throat, You cut my head but stop
this thinking.

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:11.609
I am going mad."

00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:17.570
So he developed a momentum of thinking, all
the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:23.070
Now what happens with the kundalini, when
the kundalini rises, passes through your Agnya

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:30.039
Chakra, you go beyond thinking.

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:35.159
It is like one wave of thought comes up and
goes down, another wave of thought comes up

00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:37.490
and goes down.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:42.330
In the center there is a little space; so
one comes from the past and goes to the future,

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.889
another from the future to the past.

00:32:44.889 --> 00:32:48.690
In between there is a little space, and that
is the present.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.719
So when the kundalini rises, passes through
this Agnya Chakra â€' the one that gives

00:32:54.719 --> 00:33:01.389
you thought is the ego and the superego on
both the side, as you can see clearly -- they

00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:09.789
are sucked in; your karmas are sucked in,
your ego is sucked in, your conditioning is

00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:15.490
sucked in and you stand at the present moment.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:20.259
Then if you want to think, if you don't want
to think, you just sit down in complete silence

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.919
and enjoy yourself.

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:25.049
You become in command.

00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:30.580
Like you are standing in the water, you are
afraid of getting drowned, but if you get

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.640
into the boat you enjoy the water.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.929
But supposing you become a master swimmer,
then you can save others also from the water.

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:47.619
This is exactly what happens when a Sahaja
yogi establishes himself well, that he can

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:55.729
give salvation to so many and can save so
many people.

00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:58.960
This is how we are going to emancipate.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.580
Now the emotional side that we have is also
another extreme to which we bow?

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:12.510
And with the help of certain elements, you
will be surprised: one candle can at least

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:20.950
cure twenty-five mad people at least.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.919
It's very simple.

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:34.379
If you enlighten this light, then what happens
that enlightened light goes inside your left

00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:44.109
side and enlightens it completely and all
the negativity disappears in your collective

00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:45.710
subconscious.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:53.649
And you know who all suffer from the left
side of insanity, epilepsy, schizophrenia,

00:34:53.649 --> 00:34:58.200
all this nonsense.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:04.880
Because you stand in the center -- you are
neither on the left nor on the right -- if

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.859
you are in the center, you get rid of your
emotional problems.

00:35:08.859 --> 00:35:13.240
Now, there are spiritual problems also.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:21.380
Before as we have, I told you, thinking problem,
we have also physical problems like over-exertion.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.960
Now people are jogging.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.279
It's madness, I really tell you.

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:32.839
First, I thought there is some sort of an
earthquake that the old, young, everybody

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:33.839
running.

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:34.839
What is happening?

00:35:34.839 --> 00:35:35.839
What's wrong?

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:38.330
Where are you running?

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:41.950
Because you are over-exerting yourself.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.710
What is the need to over-exert yourself?

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:51.231
Because now a concept is that if you are muscular
-- I don't know whatever is the concept, every

00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:56.900
day changing, every day you find new, new
things -- then you become over-efficient;

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.900
you become tired.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900
It's absurd.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:05.920
We have seen in history, say, we have got
the greatest statesman and the person who

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.900
saved us from this horrible Hitler was Churchill
and what a fat man he was.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:25.420
He never did jogging in his life!

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.770
I mean, you must accept your body.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:28.770
It requires rest.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:35.130
For example, if I start jogging, I'll be nowhere
Myself because I need a lot of water to protect

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.160
the chakras which work out the emancipation.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:47.090
To Me, that is much more important than becoming
some sort of a cinema actress.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.420
There are many cinema actresses.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.590
So what?

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.140
What have they achieved?

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.470
How many people have they emancipated?

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.839
So what is your ideal in life is to be decided
first.

00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:05.770
Do you want to be all the time slave of your
body?

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:07.760
And I don't know what you get.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.640
I mean, these days nobody looks at no one.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:18.529
They are fed up now and you can't make out
one from another because they go to the same

00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:19.980
hairdresser.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.600
One fashion starts.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.760
I have to think, "Is this he same person or
somebody else?"

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:35.770
I mean, it is better to grow your beard to
look something different.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.059
I mean, there no way of making out who is
who!

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:45.670
Everybody has the same hair dress, everybody
has the same funny dress, everybody looking

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.670
the same.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.560
They have no personality.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.839
Tomorrow a wave comes that you should put
a plastic bag on your head -- everybody will

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:59.730
be moving with a plastic head.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.570
We have to have a personality.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:06.380
Why should we dress up as everybody is dressing
up?

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.950
Such a pressure.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:14.030
I know that because I have another life which
you know very well which is supposed to be

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:18.420
the high society -- so-called.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.880
And the stupidest thing we discuss in that
society.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:30.780
Like they laugh at a woman if she is wearing
something that was, say, belonging to sixties.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.980
I mean, what's the harm?

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.869
No, that's not modern!

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:41.920
But what do you gain by becoming so modern
running with the fashion?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.690
What do you gain?

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:49.309
Now the fashion in England is to make holey
pants -- you make holes.

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:53.109
Imagine that cold, horrible cold that you
have.

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:59.770
What is the need to make holes in your pant
to get all kinds of troubles?

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.140
And then they'll have arthritis; then they'll
have this.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.240
First they had tight pants; so they developed
varicose veins.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:14.990
Now they are having such loose pants that
they will develop arthritis.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.260
These people are managing you.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.180
These manufacturers are befooling you.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:28.940
This we cannot see because we have lost our
personality.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:35.410
So we develop so many problems also because
we play into the hands of nonsenses.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:42.829
Now, say, Indian people have lived for so
many ages now so they have learnt all the

00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:44.039
lessons.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:50.200
If you go and tell them that you wear a holey
pant they'll say to/you, "Get lost!

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.340
Sorry, sir.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.530
We know everything."

00:39:52.530 --> 00:40:00.089
Now they are painting their hair and when
they are painting their hair, people say,

00:40:00.089 --> 00:40:02.539
"Why are you painting their hair?"

00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:05.220
"Oh, that's the fashion.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.410
What's wrong?"

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.180
But people become blind in that.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.130
We had three patients who became blind because
they painted their hair and some sort of a

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.630
thing -- punk, punk.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.640
They were three blind punks who came to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:29.520
Actually, you have to punch them to talk to
them.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.440
This is the society in which we live.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.020
Anybody who is sane will think I am mad.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:45.150
Like going to a lunatic asylum, you start
thinking, "Am I mad or they are mad?"

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.400
That's how it creates a stress on us.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:53.079
Let us live with our own dignity.

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:56.869
You can see Mahatma Gandhi went for his round
table conference.

00:40:56.869 --> 00:41:00.059
He wore his dhoti.

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:07.220
He didn't wear a three-piece suit and a tail
coat -- that's another nonsense!

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.750
Everybody in England has to wear a tailcoat
when they go to the Queen's party.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.869
But they can't afford.

00:41:13.869 --> 00:41:19.240
So they borrow; some are tight, some are loose.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.970
And when you see them there -- I mean, I have
been to many of them -- you can't recognize,

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:34.089
and they look so absurd and clownish that,
poor things, you know all these big, big ambassadors

00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:38.430
have to go about with that because it is supposed
to be a formal dress.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.890
I mean, what a formal dress it is.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.599
All these things pressurize you.

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:49.570
They make you feel, "Oh, you must wear a dress
like this."

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:56.670
Even when you go to some guru, he says, "All
right, you all have to wear," say, "orange

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:57.710
dress."

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:03.520
So you are forced into it; you have to wear
the orange dress.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:13.490
From where are you going to manage -- getting
rid of all this nonsense of forcing you to

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.019
do this and forcing you to do that.

00:42:16.019 --> 00:42:25.119
But here you are so individualistic and here
you are a down-to-earth personality,

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:32.880
Its not that anybody says you have to do it
but you just do it because we have our own

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.880
personality.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.540
Individualism means personality.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:46.980
And that is what when it is lost, you feel
also your guilt and your stress.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:55.069
That's possible that you stand on in your
own glory, in your own personality, in your

00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:58.670
own understanding of your spiritual value.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:07.190
So when that starts, another style of movement
comes in, like hippies.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:21.279
We become like a primitive person, you become
like a hippy, you go about like a hippy, you

00:43:21.279 --> 00:43:30.000
wear a funny dress, become a primitive personality
and think, "Oh, I have done very great thing."

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.070
I had some hippies with Me, I told you yesterday.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:41.660
So I asked them, "Why do you dress up like
this?"

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.930
They said, "We want this kind of culture."

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.830
I said, "This is primitive."

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.830
They said, "We want to be primitive."

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.030
I said, "You cannot be.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.770
Your brain is modern.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:56.920
Just by wearing these primitive things you
cannot be.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.730
Accept it, accept yourself.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:20.660
And now you have your realization and it will
work out."

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:30.131
So with all these stresses on us -- thinking
too much, futuristic personality â€' you

00:44:30.131 --> 00:44:31.779
develop the stress.

00:44:31.779 --> 00:44:43.210
Now what happens when kundalini rises, you
are beyond thought.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.030
That's called in Sanskrit as Nirvichar Samadhi
-- thoughtless awareness.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:54.930
You are fully aware -- on the contrary, you
are more aware â€' but you are in thoughtless

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.930
awareness.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:01.039
Now when I see this carpet in thoughtless
awareness, I don't think.

00:45:01.039 --> 00:45:06.089
I don't think because if I have to think,
"Oh, Baba, this is my carpet.

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:07.690
Now I have not insured it.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.650
If somebody will run away with it, then what
will happen?"

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.260
I won't be able to give any speech or anything.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:18.210
I'll be worried about the carpet only.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.200
But when I look at this carpet, I don't think.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:30.880
Only the joy of the creation of this carpet
is just pouring into Me; a beautiful blissful

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.510
feeling, that's all.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.950
I am not thinking.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:46.079
Like a very still beautiful lake which has
no ripples reflects all the beauty that is

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.930
around it, fully.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:46:00.420
A complete joy is reflected in a mind which
is absolutely still, not reacting, not accepting,

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.220
just seeing, witnessing.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:13.440
And this witness state comes into you and
you become a tranquil and a peaceful personality.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:21.089
Such peace that such a person, wherever he
goes, wherever he walks, a peaceful atmosphere

00:46:21.089 --> 00:46:23.829
prevails.

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:29.700
The nature, the elements all react to such
a personality.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:37.880
Just talking about peace or giving prizes
of peace, you do not feel peace.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:43.260
I know of people who have got Nobel Prizes
of peace are horrid.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:49.079
They look like some mad dogs.

00:46:49.079 --> 00:46:53.380
If you have to talk to them, take the barge
pole in between.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:59.550
Don't know when you'll be hit with the prize
they have got.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:05.569
And you may have to pay very dearly for meting
such a personality who is supposed to be the

00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:14.480
foundation of peace and you find it's a fountain
of violence.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:24.609
This is the situation today that we are placed
in a society which artificially expresses

00:47:24.609 --> 00:49:53.380
itself.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:50:14.980
There 

00:50:14.980 --> 01:23:35.139
is nothing genuine, nothing innate ...

First Public Program
Melbourne, Australia

00:03:11.230 --> 00:05:17.760
11 April 1991

00:05:17.760 --> 00:08:06.470
13:29
Please be seated.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:14:20.990
I think I’ll stand up and speak, would be
better now.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:53.459
14:41
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:15:01.830
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:16.839
We cannot conceptualize it, we cannot change
it, we cannot buy it, and also unfortunately

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:18.740
at this human level we cannot know it.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:41.750
The truth is that you are not this body, this
mind, this intellect, this ego, these conditionings,

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:48.080
but you are the pure spirit.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:16:02.740
The second truth is that there is a all-pervading
Power of divine love, which is very subtle

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.399
and which works out all the living work.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:12.190
You see all these beautiful flowers here,
and we take them for granted.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.910
We never even think from where have they come,
how have they come, from a one little seed

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:29.750
how – and so many varieties, so many types
– how they have been created and how they

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:35.240
grow, and how a flower becomes a fruit.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.940
Look at ourselves; look at our eyes.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.800
It’s one of the greatest cameras you could
think of.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.040
Look at every machinery that is within us,
how it is working beautifully there.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.320
But we do not think about it; we take it for
granted.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.890
All this living work is done by this all-pervading
Power of divine love.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:06.870
Now when I say that, you need not accept it
blindfolded.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:15.409
But I would request you to have a scientific
mind, have a scientific attitude that you

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:17.699
keep yourself open.

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:28.940
Treat this as a hypothesis, and if it is proved
then you have to accept it as truth, if you

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:41.040
are honest, because it is not only for individual
emancipation but for the emancipation of the

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.080
whole world.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:18:02.320
As I have told you that truth cannot be understood
or felt at this human level because we are

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.900
mental, at the most, if not emotional being,
or we are mixture of both.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:15.550
We are a bundle of conditionings and egos
and everything, but we are not our selves.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:22.130
When we say “my ego”, “my intelligence”,
“my body” – but where is this “my”?

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.030
From where does this word “my” comes?

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.730
This is what is the spirit within us.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:44.530
You have been already explained about a mechanism
we have here … and you have been already

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:54.080
told this kind of a mechanism exists within
us.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.280
(If you remove this one would be better, I
think.)

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:10.010
Now this mechanism does exist within us, and
is for your last breakthrough in your evolutionary

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.360
process.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:20.790
You have become from amoeba to a human state,
but we have not yet known the absolute truth.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:28.270
We have not yet known the absolute knowledge.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:33.809
[Microphone falls down.]

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:46.740
All right, now can you see that?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:56.460
It’s just for your seeing we are managing
something!

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.400
It’s all right.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:07.840
But this is all within yourself, is all within
yourself which is not going to fall out!

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:24.630
So, we have this mechanism, as I told you,
for your last breakthrough.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:30.780
If we had known the absolute truth and if
we had the absolute knowledge, there would

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:41.130
have been no quarrelling, no different “isms”;
there would have been no wars.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:49.530
But because we haven’t got that, we are
separated by ignorance, and everybody thinks

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.130
“I’m right.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:58.010
Whatever I am doing is the correct thing and
whatever I am thinking is the correct thing.”

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.890
But there is no way to judge whether it is
correct or not.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:10.880
Like when you say it’s a one meter long,
then we have a meter, as you know, in the

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:19.710
Museum of Paris which is kept as one meter
all the time.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:28.410
But that, unless and until you discover we
are living in a relative world without any

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.650
absolute relativity.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:36.360
That’s why there is chaos; that’s why
there are problems.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:46.240
Most of the problems if you see are created
by human beings.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:54.290
These problems, if you just try to locate,
are just based because we haven’t found

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.350
out the absolute knowledge.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:02.880
For example, if this place is completely dark
and you can’t see anyone and if you start

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:09.590
all running, you’ll hit someone, somebody
will fall down, somebody will be beaten up,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:17.650
somebody might get hurt because there is darkness,
there is confusion.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:23.040
These are the days of the greatest confusion
that we are born in, and it’s promised that

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.220
in those days of confusion only you are going
to find out the truth.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:34.360
That’s why there is a category of people,
as William Blake has said, are the men of

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:42.550
God who will find themselves and they will
make others the men of God.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:50.880
The time has come for you all to have your
Self-realization, your self-knowledge.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.840
As a result of that you develop a new awareness.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.990
You develop – again I say it’s a question
of becoming; it is not certifying – you

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:11.420
develop a new awareness on your central nervous
system, which we call as “collective consciousness.”

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.690
Is described by Jung very clearly.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:25.660
This is where you can feel your centers on
your fingertips, and you can feel the centers

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.250
of other people on your fingertips.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:35.750
Now only thing you have to do is to know what
do they denote – this decoding has been

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.190
done already – and how to correct them.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:47.910
So, to correct your being physically, mentally,
emotionally and also spiritually, you have

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.030
to enter inside your being – which you cannot.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:58.600
For example, you are paying attention to Me,
but if I say “pay attention to yourself”

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.630
you cannot.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.630
You cannot pay attention to yourself inside.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:08.049
So something has to happen, and this something
is the awakening of this residual power which

00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:09.910
we call as “kundalini.”

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:18.380
It’s a Sanskrit word: “kundal” means
“the coils” and is there in three-and-a-half

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.919
coils, this energy is settled down.

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:30.900
If this energy is awakened, just like a primule
in a seed – it’s a living process – just

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:40.380
like a seed sprouts, this kundalini gets awakened,
passes through six centers, pierces through

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:46.740
the last one, and you yourself feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.200
And then for the first time you start feeling
this cool breeze – it’s not very cool,

00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:00.450
it’s very pleasantly cool – which is the
all-pervading Power of divine love.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:06.600
With this you become like a divine computer.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:13.710
You can feel the centers which are in trouble
within yourself.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.010
You can feel the centers of people around.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:23.840
You can feel the centers of people who are
far away, also the centers of people who are

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.960
dead and gone.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.630
That’s how you can know who was a realized
soul who came on this Earth, and who was a

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.070
nasty fellow and who was a devil.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.900
Otherwise there is no way of making out.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:44.470
For example, from India people get out of
the jail, immediately they wear these saffron-colored

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:50.600
clothes and are in Australia: they become
big gurus.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.720
And Australians had lot of money, and they
have really fed them with that.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.020
So many of them are coming down.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.640
But not so many, because so many are exposed
also, so many are in jail, so many have died.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.799
But still, they can say that “the world
is coming to an end, and you must do this.

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:13.680
This is happening, and you must do that”;
and just frighten you.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.370
And you think, “Oh, otherwise, you see,
how can they tell lies?”

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.970
But they are thieves!

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:25.450
They are coming from the jail direct – you
find out their bona fides: from what kind

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.890
of families they come, what sort of education
they have had?

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:35.660
But blindfolded, people go to them and get
infected by them.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.350
Mostly they are mesmerizers and they spoil
your chances of your ascent.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:46.090
Not only that: they can give you some diseases,
they can give you some sort of a brain – you

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.270
might have an effect of your taking a drug.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.950
Anything can they do, I don’t know to what
extent they can go; because so many have come

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:59.450
to Me, and I am really now fed up the way
people are still running after them, paying

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:00.450
them money.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.660
It’s something like you see some people
coming out of the pub and falling down on

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:12.200
the street, and others try to push their way
inside to get again the same way.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.130
But in spirituality you have to know that
you cannot pay.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:22.860
It’s a living process of living energy;
it’s a living process.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.960
(Will you take photographs afterwards?

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.400
All right?)

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.071
So the second thing that should happen to
you as a result of Self-realization, that

00:27:37.071 --> 00:27:41.530
you get empowered yourself.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.740
You yourself can give realizations to others.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:52.860
You can find out about another person, you
can give them realization, you can cure them.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.870
You can help them in every way possible.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:01.100
It’s like one enlightened light can enlighten
another light.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.610
You are all ready for it, absolutely ready
to get enlightened.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:12.730
I don’t have to do much, you will see that
– how easily you all can get your realization.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:18.520
It has to be easy, it has to be sahaj, it
has to be spontaneous, because the time has

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520
come.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:26.030
And also this all-pervading Power has become
extremely active, extremely active, and it

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.270
is working wonders everywhere.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:38.820
When the kundalini rises on this center, then
you reach a state which we call as thoughtless

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.000
awareness – in Sanskrit it’s called as
“nirvichar samadhi.”

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.909
When you watch something you just watch, you
don’t think.

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:49.880
If you want to think you can think, but you
are not bombarded by thoughts, you are not

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.710
under the control of thoughts.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:58.910
Then she rises above and pierces through here,
and establishes a connection properly: then

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:04.309
you get into another kind of a higher awareness
we call as “nirvikalpa samadhi”, which

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:12.040
is a doubtless awareness, in which you start
raising the kundalini of others, curing others,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:18.080
helping others, knowing such a lot of knowledge;
because once this kundalini goes into the

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:26.060
limbic area, she enlightens these thousand
petals there – that is the thousand nerves.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:34.190
Many children I’ve seen who have been absolutely
very dull children now are scoring above everybody

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.530
else, getting scholarships.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:45.679
We have some boys who have done their engineering
or chartered accountancy and all this thing

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:48.260
in very, very record time; they have records.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:56.450
They always stand first and they are doing
very well in their education, but despite

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.909
all that they are extremely humble and obedient.

00:29:59.909 --> 00:30:06.480
They respect their teachers, they respect
everyone; because the new virtue which has

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:13.350
come in them is the respect, to respect others,
which we have lost long time back.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:20.000
The second thing that happens to a person
is this: that you become absolutely free.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.090
Of course, in the beginning also I respect
your freedom.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.309
I cannot force Self-realization on you – you
have to ask for it.

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:32.120
Otherwise, I cannot force it on you.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:38.230
But when you get your Self-realization you
become really free, in the sense that you

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.990
are able to be free.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:48.370
Like we think we are free, but we have addictions,
we are slaves to so many things, we cannot

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.090
control ourselves; so we are not free.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:57.210
But when you become a self-realized person
all such things which dominate us – whether

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:04.679
it’s addiction, alcoholism, any habit, any
such thing, tempers, or too much interest

00:31:04.679 --> 00:31:13.929
in wrong things – all drops out and you
become really a able person: absolutely you

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:21.100
have the ability to be enjoying your freedom
and your virtues.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:31.620
Then it happens that you start seeing everything,
as I told you, and not getting into thoughts.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:37.600
The human nature is such that whatever you
see, you react.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.510
But after getting Self-realization you do
not react, and your mind is thoughtless.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:54.640
It’s like a lake which has no ripples on
it, and all that is created around that lake

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640
is reflected inside.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.720
In the same way when you watch something,
you just watch it.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.549
Now I watch these flowers: I’m just watching,
and all the joy that the Creator has put it

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:10.370
in it, it doesn’t come to Me as words but
as joy itself, and it starts pouring on Me

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.590
and it soothes Me down.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:20.289
You become a person without tension, because
tension comes to you through thoughts.

00:32:20.289 --> 00:32:24.880
But thoughts are coming from the past or from
the future, and they throng your head and

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.120
give you this tension.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:37.520
When the kundalini rises she comes in between
two thoughts, so the future and past – the

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.279
kundalini is in the center, that is, in the
present.

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:46.880
So you just stand in the present, and when
you are in the present there is no tension

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.830
in your mind.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.710
These days there’s a big trouble people
are having of tensions, blood pressures and

00:32:54.710 --> 00:33:01.440
all kinds of things, which are absolutely
there because this window has not yet opened

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.440
out.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.630
Once it has opened out everything goes away,
and you are extremely a relaxed person.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.882
You also reduce at least ten years of your
age.

00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:15.340
As you know, I am sixty-eight years of age
and I am travelling every third or fourth

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.270
day all over the world.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.340
So you get very dynamic and you get such a
lot of energy within you.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:29.570
At the same time you are very compassionate,
you are very considerate, and you are extremely

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.570
wise.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:36.539
In every way you are helped: you are helped
in your business, you are helped in your work,

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:38.710
you are helped in your relationship with,
in your family, with others, and the whole

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.120
thing becomes like a beautiful drama you are
playing.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.770
I’m telling, all these things sound very
fantastic to you, and should find – because

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.130
you might say “we have never seen such angels
before.”

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.190
But there is a chance for all of you to become
that.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:34:01.679
Supposing you take a television into a remote
village of India where they have never seen

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:06.620
a television, and tell them that “you can
see pictures from all over the world inside

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.620
this.”

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.831
They’ll say, “What, this box?

00:34:08.831 --> 00:34:10.690
Useless thing – how can it be?”

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.349
But when you put it to the mains, then they
see the miracles of it.

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:21.179
In the same way when you are put it, you are
put to the mains you start seeing the miracles

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:22.179
of your being.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:28.340
Then you understand how glorified you are,
how beautiful you are, and what is the purpose

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.340
of your life.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.310
There’s no end to this knowledge.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.990
For example, in here so many lights I see
here, but to put them on there might be only

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:42.800
one switch and you can put on all the lights.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.339
But supposing I have to tell you all the history,
how it came and how the electricity came,

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:52.980
and then how it was brought in Melbourne and
how it was fixed and everything, it’s quite

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:53.980
boring.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.750
So the best thing is just to put on the light
first.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:03.020
So I would request you, you’d better have
your Self-realization first and then understand,

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.390
because it’s a very subtle subject and I
don’t know how many thousand lectures I

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.050
have given only in English language.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:15.760
There are many other languages I speak, but
only in English language I don’t know how

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.830
many lectures I have given, and every time
they say, “Mother, every time You say something

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.830
new.”

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:26.920
I am giving you thus a introduction to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:33.060
Now, once you get your realization you have
to know it works on collectivity.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.700
It’s not that you go home and say, “All
right, Mother, I am meditating at home.”

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.220
It would be like a nail cut out of the body.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:47.270
You don’t have to pay for anything, but
you have to give some time for your Self-realization

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.619
and you have to come to the collective.

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:54.570
Luckily in Melbourne we have wonderful people
who have achieved great heights in Sahaja

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.570
Yoga.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:36:00.650
They are extremely humble, they are extremely
beautiful people, and I’m sure they’ll

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.170
help you to achieve the same heights as they
have achieved.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.170
This is what we have to get.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:12.099
We have to emancipate the human beings to
solve all our problems, to enter into the

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:13.200
Kingdom of God.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.349
This has been promised, and this promise has
to be fulfilled.

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:24.190
Of course, before I go ahead with the process
of Self-realization which will take ten minutes

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.359
only, I would request you to ask Me questions.

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:36.720
But ask relevant questions, questions which
show your curiosity to get your realization,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.359
because I’m not here for any votes, nor
am I here for any money.

00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:46.250
I am here to give you your own key of your
own treasures.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:53.900
So accordingly, please ask Me questions.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:37:02.890
I’ll be very thankful to you.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:08.890
May God bless you.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:33.960
[Question: He says he thinks he is reaching
that stage, but could You tell him the symptoms?]

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.310
Yes.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:39.360
We’ll tell him.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:47.070
You see, first what happens, that you start
feeling the cool breeze out of your head.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:54.660
Sometimes you might get hot also, hot breeze
coming out; then you start feeling the cool

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.060
breeze all around it.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:05.339
Then you become aware of it and you work it
out.

00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:09.180
Then you give realizations to others.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.860
All these things happen, and you become extremely
peaceful, loving, affectionate, and a righteous

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.860
person – you become.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:22.570
It’s not like following any religion as
such, because when we follow a religion we

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.710
can do, we can commit any mistakes; any sins
we can commit.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:31.830
But Sahaja Yoga is such that religion is born
within you – like here, as we have got eight

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:36.940
valencies within us, ten valencies within
us, and these ten valencies are in this green

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.550
part: when they’re awakened, you become
religious.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.550
You become.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.930
You are not to be told, you just become.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.570
I don’t have to tell you “don’t do this”
– I never say that.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:56.080
It just happens, because you see in the light
what is right and what is wrong.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:17.013
[Question: What is God, for You, and is God
a separate entity?]

00:39:17.013 --> 00:39:18.013
Ya, He is.

00:39:18.013 --> 00:39:20.560
He is, and God for Me is the one who is witnessing
everything.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:27.000
But He has His Power which is the Primordial
Mother, which is the Holy Ghost, which is

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.330
reflected within you as the kundalini, and
God is reflected within you as the spirit

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.330
in your heart.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.810
At this point they meet, and that’s how
you get your Self-realization.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:48.550
But such a wide subject it is, so you have
to have more patience for such a wider subject.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:40:16.830
[Question: Will there ever come a time when
the negative force in society will cease to

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.590
exist?]

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:26.270
Yes, of course, if you help us.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.660
[Question: Which Indian saints or masters
do You acknowledge, or did any of them inspire

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.680
You in Your cause?]

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:38.599
Yah, all of them were there, and there are
some more but they have all disappeared in

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:44.730
the Himalayas, because they say that “these
human beings are absolutely dullards and they

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:49.520
won’t listen to us; You try Your luck!”

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:58.751
We have so many saints in India who are no
more, who really came down to the masses.

00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:05.760
The first one who really ventured to talk
to masses was Gyaneshwara, Saint Gyaneshwara.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.330
About kundalini it was written in so many
Sanskrit books, so many of them, you see,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:15.180
but never in a local or a vernacular language.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.530
So Gyaneshwara in the twelfth century first
time talked about it.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:25.839
He took the permission of his master – because
it was a tradition to have one master and

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:32.450
one disciple – and he wrote it about it
in his book first of all.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:36.840
And today the time has come for you to get
en masse realization.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:44.710
There are so many saints that I really, in
this thing I cannot tell you, but there was

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:51.200
Ramadasa, there is Nanaka, there is Kabira
– so many of them – Adi Shankaracharya;

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.070
in India, as you ask.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:42:02.770
But outside also: William Blake was another
saint.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:19.720
[Question: He says that T.M.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:29.890
talks about Self-realization.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:41.890
What is the difference between their talking
about Self-realization and You talking about

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:42.890
it?]

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.940
Now they have started.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.800
They never talked about it before, and they
are just talking.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.790
If I have to tell you everything frankly about
T.M., it’s better that you listen to it.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.230
I’m not afraid of them.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:43:03.130
I had the head of their siddha – what they
call the “flying academy” – head of

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:09.829
that, the director, one Mr. Peter Pearce,
his wife, his deputy director and his child,

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:12.070
all suffering from epilepsy, came to Me.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:18.300
Luckily My husband was not at home those days,
so I kept them in My house and treated them,

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.800
and got them well.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.119
He’s about to write a book about it.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:25.090
Now I asked him what do they do.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:31.089
So he told Me – because he was in it – he
said that they give three mantras, first stage

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:39.480
they give three mantras, and these three mantras,
they were to pay three thousand pounds.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:45.200
Now these three mantras, out of them any one
could be yours.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:51.680
One was “inga”, another was “pinga”,
another was “tinga”.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.550
Now any Indian would laugh at it because they
know there is, these are not Sanskrit words.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:01.310
“Inga” means the scorpion bite; the “pinga”
means a person when he gets possessed, he

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:06.290
goes round, is called “pinga” – it is
also in vernacular language, not in Sanskrit

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.430
– and “tinga” means showing like this.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.760
And they paid three thousand – done!

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.420
It’s all marketing.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.640
People are so stupid!

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:23.760
I mean, I have a disciple who came to Me from
T.M., her sister was in lunatic asylum.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.640
We had to work so hard on her, but now she’s
cured; and this barrister girl, poor thing,

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.200
she suffered so much.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.120
So many people have gone into recluses.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.840
She told Me that she had to go to Switzerland,
pay six thousand pounds for a course of seven

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840
days.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.470
And the first day they were given – this
is for flying in the air.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:51.050
Now this is also another stupidity, to go
for flying in the air, half-way through – what

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.050
is the need?

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:58.040
As it is, today there was such a lot of jam;
you see, if you start flying like this, then

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.490
no car can move!

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.140
What is the need for you to fly at three feet?

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.920
But this is stupidity, and for that stupidity
she paid six thousand pounds.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:13.599
And she had to go to Switzerland, and she
said, “No arrangements for us, nothing.

00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:21.510
We were to live in a big hall, and they asked
us that we have to jump on, what you call

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:28.119
these foam mattresses,” and she broke her
bottom, and many broke their bottom.

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:32.420
And they were asked, they were asked to give.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.970
And they were given to drink the water that
boiled the potatoes for six days, and the

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.520
seventh day they were given the rind, and
the fifth day the potatoes.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.230
For that they paid six thousand pounds!

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:51.920
She’s a daughter of a very, very rich man.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.150
But this is what it is, if you have surplus
money there are people to befool you.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.180
There’s a market, it’s all marketing.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.390
Now they are marketing what you call ayurveda.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.880
What is there to market ayurveda?

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.840
You can buy things directly from India; you
don’t need a guru for that.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.220
And most of the ayurveda cannot be practiced
abroad because these are made out of fresh

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.230
leaves.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:21.960
But if you have to treat yourself with ayurveda
you can go to India.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:28.480
But Sahaja Yoga is a direct method that you
can cure yourself by, with your kundalini

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480
awakening.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:36.370
There are two doctors in Delhi University
who have got their M.D.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:42.420
on Sahaja Yoga, which proved that Sahaja Yoga
can cure many incurable diseases.

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.420
We have cured.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:50.060
Not that I have cured, but people are cured
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.829
Diseases like blood cancer, myelitis, so many
diseases have been cured, and there are so

00:46:55.829 --> 00:47:00.040
many that I really do not know how to even
keep account.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.589
We cannot keep account of them.

00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:03.589
So this is what T.M. is.

00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:05.260
Whatever they talk, they should prove it.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.790
Have you met any T.M.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:17.240
fellow who can give realizations to others,
or who can talk like Stephen?

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.829
There is no modus operandi.

00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:22.500
There is no modus operandi they can describe
– nothing.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.320
On the contrary, if you are a doctor you can
find them out just like that.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:35.190
Once in a lecture there was a Sahaja yogi,
who is now head of the Psychology Department

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:40.650
in Amman – he was there in their meetings
– and they said that when you take the brain

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.300
scan, you see the theta waves.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:48.810
Immediately he got up, he said, “But you
get it with epilepsy; you get it with epilepsy.”

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.810
And they were shocked.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.570
They just got round him and said, “Doctor,
will you come and have some tea with us?”

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.570
and this.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:00.180
Then he went there and they were offering
him money and all that.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.660
Is all money business.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.650
If you have intelligence you can understand
it, that it’s all money.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.810
You cannot purchase it.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.800
How much money did you give to Christ?

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:17.230
How much money did you give to Krishna or
to Rama, or to any one of them?

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:26.670
Those people whom you can purchase are your
servants; they cannot be your gurus.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:36.920
[Seeker: I was in Siddha Yoga for seven years
and I have a lot of problems.]

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.310
You will, but I know that, I’ll manage that.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.310
It’s very difficult, but I’ll manage.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.470
I know, with all these yogas you get nothing
but trouble.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.470
I know that.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:47.210
[Seeker: I tend to get very sleepy and tired,
and meditation makes me even sleepier.]

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.300
I know.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.930
I know that.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.190
I’ll help you, don’t you worry.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.910
I’ll help you, all right?

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.910
Definitely.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.319
I know this is not only your case, it’s
so many.

00:48:59.319 --> 00:49:00.849
But in Australia he was so popular.

00:49:00.849 --> 00:49:04.740
I don’t know why he was so popular here.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.640
You are supposed to be much more intelligent
than normal people!

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.630
Aren’t you?

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:24.589
[Question: What are Your views on eating meat,
as opposed to vegetarianism?]

00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:35.630
You see, we, in Sahaja Yoga we treat a person
according to his needs.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:39.220
Supposing you need proteins, you have to have
proteins.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.980
Supposing you need more carbohydrates, so
you have to have carbohydrates.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.770
It’s a balancing thing.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:50.240
By eating meat or anything – like you think,
if you save some chickens, can I give them

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.240
realization?

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.590
Simple question.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:55.440
So we are paying too much attention to all
nonsensical things.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.970
What you have to think, what we are human
beings on top of everything.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:05.630
Of course, some people don’t have to eat
meat because they have problems; but some

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.250
people have to eat meat because they have
problems.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:21.490
We have to be logical about everything.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.030
These are all fads, or “isms”.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:31.349
These are fads: don’t do this, wear this
kind of a dress, go on the street and sing

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:35.839
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna” or do another
nonsensical thing, or jump here.

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:38.089
These are all fads and fashions.

00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:44.290
The fashion started that you should put a
tin on your head and tie up your hair, bouffant

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:45.290
or something.

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.500
Everybody started doing that.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.040
We must have our individuality, we should
have our personality.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.590
How can we accept anything that comes in the
way?

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:58.600
And these entrepreneurs are playing with you,
so these gurus also play with you.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.300
We should be alert now – we have already
suffered a lot, haven’t we?

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:09.740
[Question: What’s Your opinion of Swami
Muktananda?]

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.750
Ah.

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.530
Better not ask!

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:21.470
You know, I have got just now a complete file
on him, from America they have published:

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.349
he’s such a horrible man.

00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:27.400
If you want you can read it, but I assure
you will not be able to eat food for at least

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.890
eight days.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:33.420
He had relations with even thirteen-year-old
girls.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.180
What are you asking about a swami like that?

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.230
Useless fellow!

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.310
[Question: Sai Baba?]

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.390
Another horrible person.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:46.400
He is giving you diamonds.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.030
Who has given diamonds to others?

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.349
Who wants diamonds?

00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:52.980
From where does he get diamonds?

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.180
You know that very well.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.380
He gets even Swiss watches.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.380
People are so stupid!

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:04.950
You are talking of spirituality and of God,
not of these mundane things.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.410
If you want you can go in the market and get
a diamond; even if you don’t get, doesn’t

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:10.410
matter.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:18.240
Those who have it or have not, nothing wrong
with them.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.013
Look at his, their faces, how they look.

00:52:23.013 --> 00:52:25.190
I tell you, how can you be enamored by these
things?

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:33.220
You always talk of materialism, you talk against
it and then you get enamored by these people

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.170
because they are in America.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:41.349
When I went there in Boston – can you imagine,
Americans are the best for this – so that

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:43.720
they asked Me, “How many Rolls-Royces You
have?”

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.010
I said, “I have none.”

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.329
They said, “Then we are not interested in
You.”

00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:50.069
Can you imagine?

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:56.349
If you are going to impress by these things
you are not going to get to the real thing

00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:58.710
– is definite.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:04.810
These all things can be bought by money, but
you cannot buy reality with money.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:08.370
Take it from Me, you cannot.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.492
It has to happen – is a fact.

00:53:10.492 --> 00:53:11.492
I am telling you the truth, whether you like
it or not.

00:53:11.492 --> 00:53:14.020
[Question: Is there an energy field that is
built up by raising the kundalini en masse,

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:50.710
and does it spill over into another area?]

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:54.220
I think, you see, before describing it you’d
better feel it.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.220
All right?

00:53:55.220 --> 00:54:00.420
What’s the use of describing the beautiful
Australia unless and until you visit it?

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:08.640
Better feel it yourself and then you will
know.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.830
All right?

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.930
Yes?

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:21.780
[Question from seeker about kundalini raising
giving her headaches.]

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:32.540
She’s a … With whom did she do this kundalini
awakening?

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.920
Do you know?

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.069
…. Ah, must be somebody like that.

00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:45.800
You see, kundalini is your mother, all right,
and she is anxious to give you a second birth.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.500
She works it out herself, beautifully, like
your mother gave you the birth without giving

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.230
you any trouble.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.050
That’s how she works it out.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:06.510
But if you go to a person who’s not authorized
spiritually, they do all these things.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:11.800
I have not seen, but – now as they must
have told you that we are working in about

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:17.510
fifty-four nations, and I must have visited
at least forty-five of them – I have never

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.660
seen anybody suffering because of kundalini
awakening.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.819
On the contrary, feeling very much better.

00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:26.309
This is what it is.

00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:34.810
You must see first of all when you go to somebody:
what about the disciples, how are they?

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.859
How are they behaving?

00:55:36.859 --> 00:55:39.640
Are they beautiful people?

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.510
Have they achieved anything, have they got
anything?

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:47.069
And also you must see the life of the so-called
guru.

00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:48.630
How does he live?

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.550
Where is his interest?

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:57.589
But headlong if you fall into something you
are going to suffer, isn’t it?

00:55:57.589 --> 00:56:04.810
Now I’ve been coming to Australia for the
last, how many, from the year ’78 I think,

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:11.900
’77 or ’78; but I saw all the people were
scattered around these people, not around

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.900
Me.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.880
They all like them, all such kinds.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.630
They wouldn’t come to Me.

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.780
Even some people advised Me that “You’d
better charge some money.”

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.680
I said, “How much will you pay?

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.460
Tell Me.”

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.099
This is invaluable – you can’t pay for
it.

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:33.589
[Question: Could You suggest anything that
would help her, now that she’s in that situation,

00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:35.109
please?]

00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:36.619
Help!

00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:46.589
Doesn’t matter, we have people there also.

00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:50.890
You give us her address, we’ll find out
for her.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.609
Australia and Iceland’s quite close, isn’t
it!

00:56:53.609 --> 00:56:55.850
But sweet of you to remember her.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:57:17.640
[Question: When she meditates she feels the
kundalini rising, but suddenly it drops down

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.240
again.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:35.790
How does she keep it up?]

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.630
You have been in Sahaja Yoga?

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:46.510
Did you get your realization through Sahaja
Yoga?

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:51.121
You see, we do not take responsibility of
people who have been to other places, but

00:57:51.121 --> 00:57:55.200
if you have been in Sahaja Yoga then we can
find out why it is happening.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.980
If you have got your realization through Sahaja
Yoga we know, and we can help you very much

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:01.980
better.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.980
All right?

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.250
Then it’s our responsibility.

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:10.900
It does happen sometimes because if you have
problems in your brain, or maybe in your body

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:16.031
there is some disease where the kundalini
wants to help, may be happening, but it can

00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:18.170
be expedited, it can be cleared out.

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:21.650
These are all the problems which can be solved.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:38.820
You should have patience with yourself, that’s
all.

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:50.440
[Question: Could You explain levels of samadhi
and nirvana?]

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440
Ah?

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.440
Nirvana?

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.109
…. It’s too early to talk about it, but
first you get your samadhi, all right, step

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:59.829
by step, step by step.

00:58:59.829 --> 00:59:07.970
Nirvana is the same as samadhi is, but in
nirvana state the, it’s the highest that

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:10.510
you can achieve in spirituality.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:11.680
All right?

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.520
So it’s step by step we have to move.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:27.069
We can say it is the beginning of nirvana
and then you have to be working it out and

00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:31.030
you go to nirvana itself, into the complete
state.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:39.970
But one thing is definite there, that we have
to understand that these words we have read

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:49.150
from some books and the connotation of them,
it could be very, very wrong, could be very,

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.230
very misunderstood.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:59.980
So whatever is the reality you should face
it as reality, you should see it as reality:

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:06.500
not to have any concept about it, because
if you have a concept then may be that it

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.569
might be wrong.

01:00:07.569 --> 01:00:16.089
So it’s better to see for yourself.

01:00:16.089 --> 01:00:23.079
All right?

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:50.640
[Question: Is it possible for the kundalini
to be raised prematurely, or does it just

01:00:50.640 --> 01:01:01.140
rise in its own time?]

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.250
Prematurely?

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:04.250
This is …

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.250
[Question: Is it dangerous?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.250
– there are lots of written warnings that
kundalini can be dangerous?]

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.250
No, there is no danger at all in kundalini
awakening at all.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.500
As I have told you just now, she’s your
mother.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.970
There’s no danger.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:15.530
But people must have warnings because they
don’t want you to get realization, perhaps.

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.680
One might have warned because they must have
put their hands into some sort of a burning

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.099
fire, thinking it is the kundalini.

01:01:23.099 --> 01:01:24.670
So that must be the reason.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:32.750
So far, we have had thousands and thousands
and thousands of people: nobody has felt anything

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.750
bad.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:38.369
After all, when you became a human being,
what was the danger in becoming human being

01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:39.369
from a monkey stage?

01:01:39.369 --> 01:01:40.840
Did you feel the cutting of your tail even?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:53.520
So after all, you are made a human being for
a purpose, and that purpose is to make you

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.260
the higher being.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:58.100
How can it be troublesome?

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.900
It is so vitally important.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.190
Why should it be troublesome to you?

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:07.380
Use logic.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:21.520
If that is the last breakthrough of your evolution,
it has to work spontaneously and easily.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:31.740
Now, so there’s one more gentleman but now
this is the last, all right?

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.190
What is the question?

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.280
Can you get up, please?

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.839
We can’t even see you.

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.260
Thank you.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:51.650
[Question: Does Self-realization have to take
place in this life or if you believe in reincarnation,

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:57.349
does it take place over a longer period?]

01:02:57.349 --> 01:03:00.580
Some people are realized in last life, I know.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.590
They are born as realized souls also, I know.

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:09.350
But I know one thing, that they don’t know
all about it – partly they know.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.780
They have to know all about it.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.380
They have to know all about their powers.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.133
They have to know how to raise the kundalini.

01:03:18.133 --> 01:03:22.700
They have to know what is missing in their
realization.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:29.190
All that they have to know.

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:31.360
All right.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.780
So now, very simple thing we have to do, raise
…. As you know, we have to use the force

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.010
of the Mother Earth very much.

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:48.410
For that we have to take out our shoes for
a very short time.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:59.910
Those who are sitting on the ground just have
to take out shoes, that’s all, and sit comfortably.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:25.619
We have the left and the right, two sides,
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

01:04:25.619 --> 01:04:38.190
The left caters to our emotional side, and
the right to our physical and our mental side.

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:44.210
So we put both our feet apart from each other
– but those who are sitting on the ground

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:47.859
are all right, no problem – those who are
not sitting on the ground.

01:04:47.859 --> 01:04:50.600
They can sit comfortably there, just folded.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.630
Just sit whichever way you like, folded is
better.

01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:01.520
Be comfortable is the point.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.450
Before we start anything else, there are two
conditions which you have to fulfill.

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:21.799
The first one is that you have to know that
you are a human being, and you have to be

01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:35.480
confident that you will get your realization
and that it is your right to get your Self-realization.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:45.530
You are not to feel guilty about whatever
has happened in the past, because the divine

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:58.780
love is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever
mistakes you might have committed can be easily

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.050
dissolved by that ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.130
You must have faith in the power of that ocean.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:11.940
After all, you are a human being, you are
not God, and if you have done any mistakes

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.270
it’s all right.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:17.450
So don’t feel guilty, don’t condemn yourselves.

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:21.049
Those who have told you “you are sinners,”
you should know they must be the greatest

01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:22.799
sinners to say that.

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:25.730
Nobody has business to say that to anyone.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:30.150
So please have full confidence in yourself,
and not to feel guilty.

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:35.780
When you feel guilty, then this center here
on the back side there catches on, on the

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:51.010
left side, and this gives you horrible diseases
like angina, lethargic organs and also spondylitis.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.980
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all?

01:06:52.980 --> 01:07:00.619
If you think you have done mistakes, forget
it just now.

01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:08.460
Second condition is that you have to forgive
everyone in general.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:13.109
You don’t have to think about people whom
you want to forgive.

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:18.480
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you
don’t do anything.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.069
Again, logically you don’t do anything – it’s
just a myth; but if you don’t forgive then

01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:30.393
you play into wrong hands, in the sense those
who wanted to torture you or trouble you,

01:07:30.393 --> 01:07:37.869
they are quite happy, but you are suffering
mentally.

01:07:37.869 --> 01:07:46.460
So the best thing is to forgive everyone in
general, not even thinking about any individual

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.460
whatsoever.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:51.880
This is a very, very important condition.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:59.339
Every time I have seen everywhere that people
just don’t forgive, and I have to work hard

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:00.339
on them.

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:10.690
So best is, to make My situation better and
to make the whole thing work out faster, please,

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:15.090
for My sake forgive everyone, everyone.

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:21.630
These are the two conditions.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.429
That’s all.

01:08:26.429 --> 01:08:37.420
(… You know, I don’t need that now.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.239
Too … )

01:08:39.239 --> 01:08:53.900
Now please put your left hand towards Me,
and right hand on your heart.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:09:03.759
The spirit is residing in your heart.

01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:16.719
Left hand on your lap, just on your lap please,
comfortably.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.019
Now.

01:09:19.019 --> 01:09:28.089
Now we are working only on the left-hand side
with right hand, because right hand is for

01:09:28.089 --> 01:09:31.609
action and left hand is for desire.

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:37.939
So when you put the left hand towards Me,
you are desiring to have your Self-realization;

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:44.150
and with the right hand you are nourishing
your centers, yourself raising your own kundalini.

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:55.670
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:09:55.670 --> 01:10:06.209
This is the center which all the prophets
have created for us, all the great masters

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:19.679
have created for our mastery: mastery over
the divine work, divine laws.

01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:29.280
Now we take down our hand in the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.630
This is the center of pure knowledge.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:41.150
This knowledge manifests on your central nervous
system.

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:45.869
This is what is called is “bodh” from
where the word “Buddha” has come, or “Ved”

01:10:45.869 --> 01:10:51.119
from the word “vida” – meaning “feeling
on your central nervous system.”

01:10:51.119 --> 01:10:53.579
As the Gnostic: “gn” means “to know.”

01:10:53.579 --> 01:10:59.440
“Know” doesn’t mean mentally, but to
know on your central nervous system.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.030
That’s the pure knowledge.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:10.940
Now you raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:15.219
on the left-hand side.

01:11:15.219 --> 01:11:29.449
Again you take your hand onto your heart.

01:11:29.449 --> 01:11:38.800
Now please put your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.070
head to your right.

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:55.469
This is the center I’ve told you already
is in trouble when you feel guilty.

01:11:55.469 --> 01:12:07.919
Now please take your right hand on to your
forehead across, and put down your head as

01:12:07.919 --> 01:12:13.039
far as possible.

01:12:13.039 --> 01:12:24.650
This is the center where you have to forgive
everyone in general.

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:29.880
Now take back this right hand on the back
side of your head, and push back your head.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.039
Push back your head as far as possible.

01:12:35.039 --> 01:12:44.139
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, you have to say, “Oh divine

01:12:44.139 --> 01:12:53.499
Power, please forgive me if I have done anything
wrong, knowingly or unknowingly.”

01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:57.809
That I’ll tell you later on; just now I’m
telling you the position.

01:12:57.809 --> 01:13:01.889
Now stretch your palm fully.

01:13:01.889 --> 01:13:12.130
Put the center of your palm on top of the
fontanel bone area here.

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:14.199
And now press it hard.

01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:18.300
Press down your head.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:32.989
Press it hard, push back your fingers and
start moving your scalp with the pressure,

01:13:32.989 --> 01:13:34.159
seven times clockwise.

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:35.539
This is important.

01:13:35.539 --> 01:13:36.539
Push back your fingers.

01:13:36.539 --> 01:14:04.429
Put down your head fully and now go on moving
your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly.

01:14:04.429 --> 01:14:14.260
Now take down your hands.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:19.960
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:26.579
Before that you can take out your spectacles,
because you are not to open your eyes till

01:14:26.579 --> 01:14:31.219
I tell you; this might help your eyesight.

01:14:31.219 --> 01:14:47.169
Now please remember to put your feet on, away
from each other a little bit.

01:14:47.169 --> 01:14:59.280
If there’s anything tight on your neck or
on your waist, you can loosen it a little

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280
bit.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:14.810
Now put your right hand on your heart.

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:25.820
Here you ask Me a very fundamental question
– you can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:29.829
whatever you like – “Mother, am I the
spirit?

01:15:29.829 --> 01:15:32.719
Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:44.959
Ask this in your heart three times.

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:56.409
If you are the spirit then you become your
own master, because in the light of the spirit

01:15:56.409 --> 01:16:01.630
you see everything clearly.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:08.679
So now please take your hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side,

01:16:08.679 --> 01:16:15.670
press it hard.

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:27.550
Here you have to say, again a question you
have to ask Me, “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:41.139
Ask this question three times, “Mother,
am I my own master?”

01:16:41.139 --> 01:17:08.769
Three times, in your heart.

01:17:08.769 --> 01:17:16.280
As I told you, I respect your freedom and
I cannot force pure knowledge on you, so you

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.030
have to ask for it.

01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:28.929
Take your right hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

01:17:28.929 --> 01:17:40.419
here you say six times, because this center
has got six petals, “Mother, please give

01:17:40.419 --> 01:17:48.380
me self-knowledge” – or you can say “pure
knowledge” – “Mother, please give me

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.369
pure knowledge.”

01:17:51.369 --> 01:18:18.960
Say it six times.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:52.689
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:59.719
As you have asked for pure knowledge, your
kundalini has started moving upward, so we

01:18:59.719 --> 01:19:06.429
have to nourish these upper centers with self-confidence.

01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:19.889
So here you say ten times, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:34.289
Say it with full self-confidence, ten times,
“Mother, I am my own master.”

01:19:34.289 --> 01:19:52.239
I have already told you that the most important
truth about is that you are not this body,

01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:58.979
not mind, not your conditionings, your ego,
but you are pure spirit.

01:19:58.979 --> 01:20:12.170
So now raise your right hand on your heart
and say here with full confidence, twelve

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:17.010
times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:42.539
Please say it twelve times.

01:20:42.539 --> 01:20:56.209
The divine Power is the ocean of knowledge,
is the ocean of love, joy and bliss, but above

01:20:56.209 --> 01:21:00.739
all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:21:00.739 --> 01:21:06.630
So whatever mistakes you have committed can
be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:08.110
of forgiveness.

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:12.889
So please forgive yourself and raise your
right hand in the corner of your neck and

01:21:12.889 --> 01:21:21.619
your shoulder, and turn your head to your
right.

01:21:21.619 --> 01:21:34.630
Here with full confidence say sixteen times,
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:56.119
Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

01:21:56.119 --> 01:22:02.939
I have already told you, whether you forgive
or don’t forgive you don’t do anything,

01:22:02.939 --> 01:22:07.099
but if you don’t forgive then you play into
wrong hands.

01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:13.630
It’s a myth to know that you are not forgiving
someone.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.249
It’s a myth.

01:22:16.249 --> 01:22:27.789
So please raise your right hand on your forehead
across, and please put down your head as far

01:22:27.789 --> 01:22:31.369
as possible.

01:22:31.369 --> 01:22:38.309
And here with full confidence you have to
say from your heart – not how many times,

01:22:38.309 --> 01:22:44.719
from your heart – please say, it is very
important, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:53.949
Don’t say “I try” – just saying it,
with full confidence, “Mother, I forgive

01:22:53.949 --> 01:23:04.639
everyone in general.”

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:17.679
Now, take back your hand on the back side
of your head.

01:23:17.679 --> 01:23:23.190
Push back your head as far as possible.

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:38.610
Here we have to say, without feeling guilty,
without counting your mistakes; just for your

01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:46.010
satisfaction, from your heart, not how many
times, “Oh divine Power, if I have done

01:23:46.010 --> 01:24:18.030
any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please
forgive me.”

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:22.090
Now stretch your right hand.

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:34.409
Put the center of your palm on the fontanel
bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:24:34.409 --> 01:24:38.360
Now put down your head as far as possible,
put down.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.699
Push back your fingers.

01:24:40.699 --> 01:24:49.229
Here again I respect your freedom.

01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:54.840
I cannot force Self-realization on you – you
have to ask for it.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:04.119
So now push back your fingers with the pressure;
move your scalp seven times clockwise, saying

01:25:04.119 --> 01:25:17.440
seven times, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.”

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:51.070
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone seven
times.]

01:25:51.070 --> 01:26:09.079
Now please take down your hand.

01:26:09.079 --> 01:26:15.159
(If you can close the air-conditioning, they
would feel it better.)

01:26:15.159 --> 01:26:32.559
Now please put, open your eyes and put both
the hands towards Me like this, like this.

01:26:32.559 --> 01:26:41.469
Now, put your right hand like this, and don’t
think – you can manage, now you don’t

01:26:41.469 --> 01:26:42.469
think.

01:26:42.469 --> 01:26:48.893
Put the right hand and put down your head,
and see with the left hand if there is a cool

01:26:48.893 --> 01:26:54.179
breeze – can you get up and show them? – if
there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

01:26:54.179 --> 01:26:55.860
fontanel bone area.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:04.550
Now, please put the left hand away from your
head, not on top – away, not very far; some

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:10.500
people get it far also – but just try to
feel if there’s a cool breeze coming out

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:16.780
of your head.

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:24.459
Now please put your left hand towards Me like
this, like this.

01:27:24.459 --> 01:27:36.179
And now put down your head, and now see for
yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:27:36.179 --> 01:27:38.159
out of your head.

01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:42.719
(There is so much of cool breeze.)

01:27:42.719 --> 01:28:00.320
Now feel it with the right hand.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.760
Right hand towards Me and left hand: you see
it clearly, if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.349
out of your head, the fontanel bone area.

01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:12.969
You can move your hand a little bit up and
down and see for yourself on sideways.

01:28:12.969 --> 01:28:19.300
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:27.959
Push back your head and ask a question, “Mother,
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:28:27.959 --> 01:28:37.439
or ask, “Mother is this the all-pervading
Power of divine love?” or “Mother, is

01:28:37.439 --> 01:28:38.760
this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:47.849
Ask any one of these questions three times,
raising your hands.

01:28:47.849 --> 01:28:53.960
Put down your hands, please.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.229
So much of breeze already blowing all over!

01:28:57.229 --> 01:29:03.289
All those … it’s tremendous breeze already
blowing all over.

01:29:03.289 --> 01:29:08.039
It’s not air-conditioning, for your information.

01:29:08.039 --> 01:29:15.559
Now those who have felt the cool breeze out
of their fontanel bone area or on their hands

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:26.989
or fingertips, please raise both your hands.

01:29:26.989 --> 01:29:33.530
May God bless you.

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:36.090
So many of you have felt it now.

01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:38.820
Some of you have not felt, doesn’t matter.

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:46.959
Tomorrow again we have a program, and I’ll
explain to you more about the nature of spirit

01:29:46.959 --> 01:29:49.909
and the nature of these centers.

01:29:49.909 --> 01:29:56.340
Please inform your friends, everyone, to come,
and tomorrow hopefully, I will meet all of

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.909
you one by one.

01:29:58.909 --> 01:30:06.649
Also those who have problems should write
them on a piece of paper and their address,

01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:14.179
and we’ll try to contact them and help them
as far as possible.

01:30:14.179 --> 01:30:17.320
Thank you very much.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:26.630
Those who have not felt can come on this side
and the Sahaja yogis can work it out in five

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.139
minutes, those who have not felt.

01:30:28.139 --> 01:30:31.139
Because you did not forgive; I know you have
not forgiven.

01:30:31.139 --> 01:30:32.919
If you had forgiven you would have felt it.

01:30:32.919 --> 01:30:33.949
Come along, this side.

01:30:33.949 --> 01:30:39.320
Just five minutes and they’ll give you realization.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320
You felt it?

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320
Ha, good.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.169
Your problems will be solved now, it’s good.

01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:49.889
You felt it?

01:30:49.889 --> 01:30:54.769
…. Which hand you felt?

01:30:54.769 --> 01:31:03.139
Left you felt, not the right?

01:31:03.139 --> 01:31:07.219
…. Doesn’t matter.

01:31:07.219 --> 01:31:15.380
We’ll work it out.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:19.459
It’s good.

01:31:19.459 --> 01:31:21.499
Surprising!

01:31:21.499 --> 01:31:24.939
…. First of all, see on their heads are
you feeling it or not; just see it.

01:31:24.939 --> 01:31:32.300
They might be saying they are not feeling
it because of Vishuddhi.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.559
…. Yes, yes, do.

01:31:34.559 --> 01:31:56.770
[Seeker asks about her chronic low energy,
and the Hatha Yoga she has been doing.]

01:31:56.770 --> 01:32:07.900
You know, you see this modern Hatha Yoga is
most unscientific.

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:13.380
It is just done like all the medicines you
take from the medicine box, without knowing

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:14.669
what you need really.

01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:20.079
So you give up that and come to Sahaja Yoga
and know what’s wrong with you, and fill

01:32:20.079 --> 01:32:21.949
yourself with energy, all right?

01:32:21.949 --> 01:32:23.079
Is all nonsense.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:24.199
It’s all nonsense.

01:32:24.199 --> 01:32:27.010
It has given heart attacks to people, heart
attacks.

01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:29.389
It’s the way they go about it.

01:32:29.389 --> 01:32:33.300
We also do a little bit of Hatha Yoga, but
wherever it is necessary; it’s not like

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.050
mad, doing all the time there.

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:42.079
Now you have a catch on this one, you have
a catch on there.

01:32:42.079 --> 01:32:43.869
Two centers are very badly caught up.

01:32:43.869 --> 01:32:48.820
So you’d better come to Sahaja Yoga, all
right, and fix yourself up, because Hatha

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:52.239
Yoga nobody reaches God, that’s true.

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:54.679
But this Hatha Yoga is very limited: a wee
bit of it.

01:32:54.679 --> 01:33:00.999
You see, Patanjali wrote “Ashtanga Yoga”
out of which this Hatha Yoga that you do is

01:33:00.999 --> 01:33:04.570
one-eighth of one of them.

01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:09.610
And that to be is understood with the guidance
of the kundalini: where is the kundalini stopping?

01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:13.909
Whatever center it is stopping, that is the
one you have to look after.

01:33:13.909 --> 01:33:19.749
And that is the one you have to do that particular
asana for that particular thing – not all

01:33:19.749 --> 01:33:23.880
of them like that mad.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.530
All right?

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:28.939
So …. You cannot do it unless and until
you start your kundalini.

01:33:28.939 --> 01:33:32.960
Once you start your kundalini, you will know
where the problem is.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.169
It’s like if your car has started then you
will know where is the problem is, isn’t

01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:40.559
it?

01:33:40.559 --> 01:33:44.709
It’s like that.

01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:50.249
May God bless you.

01:33:50.249 --> 01:33:57.179
So now, how are you?

01:33:57.179 --> 01:33:59.949
Your sister?

01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:06.869
You are all right now?

01:34:06.869 --> 01:34:11.019
She’s in Iceland.

01:34:11.019 --> 01:34:18.360
You give her address to us, we’ll contact
her.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.360
All right.

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:29.479
What is she, now?

01:34:29.479 --> 01:34:34.449
Iceland?

01:34:34.449 --> 01:34:48.749
…. What’s the matter with her?

01:34:48.749 --> 01:35:34.111
…. You see, they will tell …. You come
and see Me, and take the photograph .… And

01:35:34.111 --> 01:35:54.489
then you send My photograph, and tell her
to put both her hands towards the photograph

01:35:54.489 --> 01:39:52.969
and both her feet in 

01:39:52.969 --> 01:43:27.890
the water with salt every night …. Both
the hands to the photograph, and both the

01:43:27.890 --> 01:44:16.379
feet in the water …. All right?

01:44:16.379 --> 01:53:08.889
But 

01:53:08.889 --> 01:53:35.469
first you master this.

01:53:35.469 --> 01:54:02.969
You felt the cool breeze?

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:57.479
[Seeker says he wasn’t sure if it was cool
or not.]

01:54:57.479 --> 01:55:07.389
Better forgive.

01:55:07.389 --> 02:02:40.019
You have to forgive …. you don’t forgive.

02:02:40.019 --> 02:04:50.019
How can I forgive for you?

02:04:50.019 --> 02:06:26.889
You have to forgive yourself, forgive everyone.

02:06:26.889 --> 02:06:55.059
I can’t forgive for you.

02:06:55.059 --> 02:07:51.399
[Seeker asks where Shri Mataji lives in India.]

02:07:51.399 --> 02:08:49.209
For practical purposes I live in London.
